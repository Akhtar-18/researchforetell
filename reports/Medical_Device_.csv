Partial Knee Arthroplasty Overview
Partial knee replacement, also known as unicompartmental knee replacement surgery is performed during knee replacement surgery when only a portion of the damaged knee is resurfaced. This procedure is an alternative to total knee replacement for patients whose disease or arthritis is limited to just one area of the knee. The areas are replaced with an artificial implant, called a prosthetic. The rest of the knee is preserved. Partial knee replacements are most often done with smaller incisions, so there is less recovery time.

Congestive Heart Failure Treatment Devices Overview
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a medical disease that reduces the strength with which the cardiac muscles pump blood. It refers to the buildup of fluid around the heart, which causes inefficient pumping. The inability of the ventricles to pump an adequate amount of blood to the body organs marks the beginning of CHF. This causes fluid to accumulate in the lungs, belly, liver, and lower body. This is largely due to the ever-changing lifestyle patterns that make people more vulnerable to arrhythmia and heart failure (such as unhealthy eating habits, heavy alcohol intake, smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity).

Carotid Stenotic Scan Devices Overview
Carotid stenosis refers to the narrowing of the carotid arteries, these are the primary blood vessels which carry the blood that is rich in oxygen to the brain. The carotid stenosis disease is also referred to as the carotid artery disease, which is caused by the building up of plaque inside the wall of the artery that tends to reduce blood flowing to the brain. Over time, plaque deposits inside the inner wall of the artery can form a large mass that narrows the lumen, the inside diameter of the artery, and cause a complete blockage of the artery.

Spinal Stenosis Overview
Spinal Stenosis is a condition in which the gaps inside the spine narrow, putting pressure on the nerves that run through it. It is most common in the lower back and neck. With age, the ligaments of the spinal column, especially the ligamentum flavum, stiffen, become less flexible, and thicken, contributing to Spinal stenosis. The degeneration of both the facet joints and the intervertebral discs causes this narrowing. Bone spurs (also known as osteophytes) develop into the spinal canal in this state. When the facet joints become arthritic, they grow, which reduces the amount of space available for the nerve roots. Facet arthropathy is the medical term for this disorder.

Carotid Artery Stent Overview
Carotid stenting is a procedure which open clogged arteries to restore blood flow to the brain. They're often performed to treat or prevent strokes. The carotid arteries are present on each side of the neck and are responsible for carrying blood to brain. These can get clogged with fatty deposits, decreasing or blocking the blood flow to the brain, and can lead to stroke. This condition is called carotid artery disease. In order to treat this, a procedure is conducted which involves temporarily inserting and inflating a tiny balloon into the clogged artery to widen the area so that blood can flow freely to brain.

Peripheral Aneurysms Overview
An aneurysm is a localized bulge in an artery caused by arterial wall weakening, which may be caused by atherosclerosis, inflammation, or injury. An aneurysm that is not found in the aorta is known as a peripheral aneurysm. They normally affect the popliteal artery in leg, but they can also affect other parts of the body which results in an abnormally dilated area. Peripheral aneurysms are treated differently depending on their size and position, as well as the state of the underlying blood vessels. If peripheral aneurysm is developed, it will not go away unless completely treated.

Dental Air Polishing Unit Overview
An alternative to rubber cup polishing for removing stains from the surface of the teeth is a dental air polishing unit. Dental air polishers use a slurry made up of sodium bicarbonate, glycine, calcium sodium phosphosilicate, and calcium carbonate to clean teeth. The dental air polishers are used for reducing biofilm, plaque, and stains on teeth. The important advantage of dental air polishing unit over rubber cup polishing is that it reduces operator’s fatigue while cleaning. Clinicians when using air polisher, without application of pressure, can clean the teeth in deep cavities and grooves of the teeth, which is not obtained by using rubber cup polishing.

Urology Lasers Overview
Laser energy has become the most commonly used modality for treatment of urinary tract calculi and is increasingly being used for soft tissue applications such as prostate ablation. Development of medical lasers has had a revolutionary impact on the treatment of urologic disease. The two most common urological conditions treated with laser devices are urolithiasis and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), and the most widely used lasers in urology are currently the holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG) for lithotripsy and BPH and the potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) for BPH.

Flow Diverters Overview
Flow diverters are stent-like devices that are deployed endovascularly to treat aneurysms. Conceptually, flow diverters allow endoluminal reconstruction rather than endosaccular filling. Flow diverters take advantage of changing the parent artery/aneurysm sac interface, for example, altering in-flow and out-flow jets, to induce aneurysm thrombosis.

A dermatoscope is the standard instrument for the first examination of skin conditions, but are sometimes used to detect other skin conditions. The dermoscopic pictures may be photographed or recorded digitally for storage or sequential evaluation. The photographs or videos are digitally processed using a digital epiluminescence dermatoscope. The dermatoscope comprises a magnifying lens and a light source for enhanced visualization of subsurface skin features.

Liquid Biopsy in Cancer Diagnostics Overview
Liquid biopsy is a method used to detect specific mutations in cell-free, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from biofluids, such as plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum. Researchers around the world are actively investigating the use of ctDNA as a biomarker for profiling tumors, monitoring the effectiveness of therapies, assessing the clonal evolution of tumor cell populations, identifying resistance mechanisms, detecting early disease, and measuring minimal residual disease. Regardless of the specific use, liquid biopsy has the benefit of being non-invasive, and thus allowing samples to be easily collected for serial assessments. Mutation detection in liquid biopsy, however, is challenged by the extremely low fraction of ctDNA in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples, making accurate detection of rare mutations difficult.

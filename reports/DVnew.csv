Aplastic Anemia Understanding
Aplastic Anemia: Overview
Aplastic anemia is a medical condition that damages stem cells in a person’s bone marrow. These cells are responsible for making red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, which are vital to human health. A rare and serious condition, aplastic anemia can develop at any age. It can occur suddenly, or it can come on slowly and worsen over time. It can be mild or severe. Treatment for aplastic anemia might include medications, blood transfusions or a stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant. The most common cause of aplastic anemia is from your immune system attacking the stem cells in your bone marrow. Other factors that can injure bone marrow and affect blood cell production include: Radiation and chemotherapy treatments, exposure to toxic chemicals, use of certain drugs, autoimmune disorders, a viral infection and unknown factors.

Vasomotor Symptoms Understanding
Vasomotor Symptoms: Overview
Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), commonly called hot flashes or flushes (HFs) and night sweats, are considered as the cardinal symptoms of menopause. VMS are a form of temperature dysfunction that occurs due to changes in gonadal hormones. Vasomotor symptoms includes hot flashes, night sweats, heart palpitations, and changes in blood pressure. Most women experience hot flashes for 6 months to 2 years, although some women have them for 10 years or longer. Hot flashes occur in approximately 75 to 80 percent of menopausal women in the United States. Hormone therapy, antidepressant drugs and lifestyle modification are ways to manage vasomotor symptoms. Lifestyle modifications, including reducing core body temperature, regular exercise, weight management, smoking cessation, and avoidance of known triggers such as hot drinks and alcohol, may be recommended to reduce mild vasomotor symptoms.

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Understanding
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: Overview
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are among a group of cancers known as sarcomas. GISTs belong to the family of sarcomas, which are malignant tumors that arise from various tissues, including fat, muscle, nerves, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels. This distinguishes sarcomas from carcinomas, which arise from the lining of organs/tissues (e.g., lung, colon, breast, prostate, and pancreas), lymphomas, which arise from immune cells in lymph nodes, and leukemias, which arise from immune cells in the bone marrow. GIST can present with a wide spectrum of subjective symptoms, such as nausea, early satiety, bloating, and weight loss. Patients can also experience objective signs of a tumor, such as anemia (low red blood cell count) or a lump in the abdomen. These signs and symptoms depend on the tumor location (e.g., stomach versus rectum), size, and pattern of growth.

""Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Hepatitis D Understanding
Hepatitis D  : Overview
Hepatitis D, also known as “delta hepatitis,” is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). Hepatitis D only occurs in people who are also infected with the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis D is spread when blood or other body fluids from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. Hepatitis D can be an acute, short-term infection or become a long-term, chronic infection. Hepatitis D can cause severe symptoms and serious illness that can lead to life-long liver damage and even death. People can become infected with both hepatitis B and hepatitis D viruses at the same time (known as “coinfection”) or get hepatitis D after first being infected with the hepatitis B virus (known as “superinfection”). There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis D. However, prevention of hepatitis B with hepatitis B vaccine also protects against future hepatitis D infection.

Open-angle glaucoma Understanding
Open-angle glaucoma: Overview
Glaucoma is an eye disease that gradually steals vision. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is a chronic, progressive, and irreversible multifactorial optic neuropathy that is characterized by an open angle of the anterior chamber, optic nerve head changes, progressive loss of peripheral vision, followed by central visual field loss. Glaucoma affects 70 million people worldwide and is the second leading cause of blindness. The underlying pathology of Open-angle glaucoma lies in the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. Open-angle glaucoma can be clinically evaluated using a variety of diagnostic tools including optic disc changes, visual field changes, and elevated intraocular pressure. The goal of treatment of open-angle glaucoma is to prevent the progression of optic nerve head changes and also the prevention of deterioration of visual field.

Nocturia Understanding
Nocturia: Overview
Nocturia is a condition that causes you to wake up during the night to urinate. This can be thought of as nocturnal urinary frequency — having to urinate more often at night. This condition becomes more common as people age and occurs in both men and women. Nocturia can be caused by: Polyuria: when a body makes too much urine in a 24-hour period, Nocturnal polyuria: when a body makes too much urine during the night, Bladder storage problems: when a bladder doesn't store or release urine well. Mixed nocturia: when more than one of these problems are happening. Nocturia can have significant health consequences. It may be connected to serious underlying problems, and nighttime bathroom trips can both disrupt sleep and create additional health concerns. Anticholinergic medications (these can reduce symptoms of an overactive bladder), Bumetanide (Bumex®), Furosemide (Lasix®) (diuretics that assist in regulating urine production), Desmopressin (DDAVP®) (helps the kidneys produce less urine) might be helpful in treating the condition.

Bacterial vaginosis Understanding
Bacterial vaginosis: Overview
Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge or malodor, affecting up to one third of US women. Most women with bacterial vaginosis are unaware of the infection, making it difficult to diagnose in the absence of a microscopic examination of vaginal discharge or using point-of-care testing. Untreated bacterial vaginosis elevates the risk of postoperative surgical infections in women undergoing obstetric and gynecological procedures. Treatment with antimicrobial agents that target bacterial vaginosis has been shown to reduce the rate of postoperative infections following hysterectomy and surgical abortions.

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria Understanding
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: Overview
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood. The disease is characterized by complement-mediated hemolysis with or without hemoglobinuria, an increased susceptibility to thrombotic episodes and/or some degree of bone marrow dysfunction. PNH leads to excessive breakdown of red blood cells, leading to the release of a large amount of haemoglobin into the urine. Symptoms and signs of PNH include: fatigue; dark red/brown urine; difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, infections, and bruising. The principal studies used to establish the diagnosis of PNH are flow cytometry of peripheral blood and bone marrow analysis. PNH typically starts from the early thirties to the mid?forties, and often persisting for decades, with a continued dependence on blood transfusions in a proportion of patients. The appropriate treatment for PNH depends on the severity of symptoms. The mainstay of PNH treatment is the drug eculizumab (Soliris).

Influenza A virus H5N1 subtype Understanding
Influenza A virus H5N1 subtype: Overview
H5N1 is called avian influenza or bird flu that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds. H5N1 is hard to transmit form people to people. But, the mortality of people infected by H5N1 is about 60%. In general, humans who catch a humanized influenza A virus (a human flu virus of type A) usually have symptoms that include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, conjunctivitis, and, in severe cases, breathing problems and pneumonia that may be fatal. There are several H5N1 vaccines for several of the avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain.

Peripheral Arterial Disease Understanding
Peripheral Arterial Disease: Overview
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) refers to diseases of the blood vessels located outside the heart and brain. PAD is a chronic disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries of the legs. It is more common in people who are 65 or older, but can occur at nearly any age. Smoking; high blood pressure; high cholesterol or triglycerides; diabetes; kidney failure; and obesity increase risk for PAD. While many people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms, some people have leg pain when walking. Possible symptoms include: Hair loss on the feet and legs, Numbness in the legs, A foot or the lower leg may feel cold, and leg weakness.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis Understanding
Postmenopausal osteoporosis: Overview
Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disorder that is characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue. Fractures of the proximal femur, the vertebrae and the distal radius are the most frequent osteoporotic fractures, although most fractures in the elderly are probably at least partly related to bone fragility. The incidence of fractures varies greatly by country, but on average up to 50% of women >50 years of age are at risk of fractures. Fractures severely affect the quality of life of an individual and are becoming a major public health problem owing to the ageing population. Postmenopausal osteoporosis, resulting from oestrogen deficiency, is the most common type of osteoporosis. Oestrogen deficiency results in an increase in bone turnover owing to effects on all types of bone cells. The imbalance in bone formation and resorption has effects on trabecular bone (loss of connectivity) and cortical bone (cortical thinning and porosity).

Retinitis Pigmentosa Understanding
Retinitis Pigmentosa: Overview
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an umbrella term for a group of hereditary progressive retinal disorders that cause progressive degeneration of the retina. The disease is inherited as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive traits. Signs of retinitis pigmentosa usually appear during childhood or adolescence. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and a loss of side (peripheral) vision. RP is diagnosed by electroretinography (ERG), visual field testing, and retinal imaging, fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF) and genetic testing. Currently, there is no therapy that stops the evolution of pigmentary retinopathies or restores the vision. Management of retinitis pigmentosa includes dietary supplements, ozone therapy, surgery etc. Gene therapy based treatments are under research focus for the treatment of Retinitis pigmentosa.

""Retinitis Pigmentosa - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Chagas disease Understanding
Chagas disease: Overview
Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. About 6 million to 7 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The disease is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 continental Latin American countries, where it is mostly transmitted to humans and other mammals by contact with faeces or urine of triatomine bugs (vector-borne), known as 'kissing bugs', among many other popular names, depending on the geographical area. Chagas disease presents itself in two phases. The initial acute phase lasts for about two months after infection. During the acute phase, a high number of parasites circulate in the blood but in most cases, symptoms are absent or mild and unspecific. During the chronic phase, the parasites are hidden mainly in the heart and digestive muscle. Up to 30% of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 10% suffer from digestive (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed alterations. Chagas disease can be treated with benznidazole and also nifurtimox.

Pyoderma gangrenosum Understanding
Pyoderma gangrenosum: Overview
Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by small, red bumps or blisters (papules or nodules) that eventually erode to form swollen open sores (ulcerations). The size and depth of the ulcerations vary greatly, and they are often extremely painful. In approximately 50 percent of cases, PG occurs secondary to another disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease. The exact cause of PG is unknown (idiopathic). Some researchers believe it may be an autoimmune disorder.

Tinnitus Understanding
Tinnitus: Overview
Tinnitus is commonly described as a ringing in the ears, but it also can sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing. It may be soft or loud, high pitched or low pitched. Tinnitus represents one of the most common and distressing otologic problems, and it causes various somatic and psychological disorders that interfere with the quality of life. The most common associated symptoms or subjective discomforts involve concentration difficulties, insomnia, and decreased speech discrimination. Tinnitus does not represent a disease itself but instead is a symptom of a variety of underlying diseases. Otologic causes include noise-induced hearing loss, presbycusis, otosclerosis, otitis, impacted cerumen, sudden deafness, Meniere's disease, and other causes of hearing loss. The most effective treatment for tinnitus is to work on the underlying cause. The underlying cause can be treatable by medical and/or surgical treatment. Approaches for tinnitus management and treatment include medications, vitamin therapy, biofeedback, hypnosis, electrical stimulation, relaxation therapy, counselling, habituation therapies, tinnitus retraining therapy [TRT], cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT], tinnitus maskers and hearing aid.

Pneumococcal infections Understanding
Pneumococcal infections: Overview
Pneumococcal infections are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive, catalase-negative organism commonly referred to as pneumococcus. The bacteria spread through contact with people who are ill or by healthy people who carry the bacteria in the back of their nose. Pneumococcal infections can be mild or severe. Symptoms of pneumococcal infections vary depending on the site of the infection. Most pneumococcal infections occur in the Lungs (pneumonia), Middle ear (otitis media, which is common among children), Sinuses (sinusitis) Pneumococcal infections usually fall into one of two categories: non-invasive pneumococcal infections – these occur outside the major organs or the blood and tend to be less serious and invasive pneumococcal infections – these occur inside a major organ or the blood and tend to be more serious. People with a weakened immune system are most at risk of catching a pneumococcal infection. Diagnosis is based on the physical exam and medical history. Treatment is with antibiotics and vaccines that can prevent pneumococcal infections.

""Pneumococcal infections - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Pneumococcal infections pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Pneumococcal infections treatment guidelines.

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infections Understanding
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infections: Overview
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most successful modern pathogens. The same organism that lives as a commensal and is transmitted in both health-care and community settings is also a leading cause of bacteraemia, endocarditis, skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections and hospital-acquired infections. Genetically diverse, the epidemiology of MRSA is primarily characterized by the serial emergence of epidemic strains. Although its incidence has recently declined in some regions, MRSA still poses a formidable clinical threat, with persistently high morbidity and mortality. Successful treatment remains challenging and requires the evaluation of both novel antimicrobials and adjunctive aspects of care, such as infectious disease consultation, echocardiography and source control.

Lipodystrophy Understanding
Lipodystrophy: Overview
Lipodystrophy refers to medical problem where there is an abnormal distribution of fat in the body. The disease may be inherited genetically, (for example, familial partial lipodystrophy or FPLD), or acquired. If inherited it may be present at birth (congenital). There are five types of lipodystrophy: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy, acquired generalized lipodystrophy, Acquired partial lipodystrophy, High active antiretroviral therapy-induced lipodystrophy, and Localized lipodystrophy. The specific symptoms present, severity, and prognosis can vary greatly depending upon the specific type of lipodystrophy and the presence and extent of associated symptoms. To make the medical diagnosis of lipodystrophy the doctor first examine the abnormal appearance caused by changes in fat loss or gain, and then he or she generally look for the characteristic clinical symptoms and signs.

Leigh disease Understanding
Leigh disease: Overview
Leigh syndrome is a rare genetic neurometabolic disorder. It is characterized by the degeneration of the central nervous system (i.e., brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve). The symptoms of Leigh syndrome usually begin between the ages of three months and two years, but some patients do not exhibit signs and symptoms until several years later. Symptoms are associated with progressive neurological deterioration and may include loss of previously acquired motor skills, loss of appetite, vomiting, irritability, and/or seizure activity. As Leigh syndrome progresses, symptoms may also include generalized weakness, lack of muscle tone (hypotonia), and episodes of lactic acidosis, which may lead to impairment of respiratory and kidney function.

Irritable bowel syndrome Understanding
Irritable bowel syndrome: Overview
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms that occur together, including repeated pain in your abdomen and changes in your bowel movements, which may be diarrhea, constipation, or both. With IBS, you have these symptoms without any visible signs of damage or disease in your digestive tract. The most common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are pain in your abdomen, often related to your bowel movements, and changes in your bowel movements. These changes may be diarrhea, constipation, or both, depending on what type of IBS you have. To diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), doctors review the symptoms and the medical and family history and perform a physical exam. The doctor will look for a certain pattern in the symptoms. In some cases, doctors may order tests to rule out other health problems.

Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (8) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII (FVIII), a clotting protein. Hemophilia is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Hemophilia can vary in its severity, depending upon the particular type of mutation (genetic defect). The degree of symptoms depends upon the levels of the affected clotting factor. Symptoms of Hemophilia A include excessive bleeding from any site in the body along with long-term damage to joints from repeated bleeding episodes is characteristic. Diagnosis for suspected hemophilia include tests like Complete blood cell count, Screening coagulation studies, FVIII assay and FVIII inhibitor assay. Treatment goal for hemophilia is to replace the missing blood clotting factor so that the blood can clot properly. Medication to treat hemophilia A is concentrated FVIII product. Several new treatments for hemophilia A are under development, from gene therapy to new non-factor replacement therapies.

BK Virus infections Understanding
BK Virus infections: Overview
The BK virus was first isolated from the urine of a renal transplant recipient with ureteric stenosis in 1971. The BK virus is a member of the polyomavirus family. The BK virus rarely causes disease but is typically associated with patients who have had a kidney transplant; many people who are infected with this virus are asymptomatic. If symptoms do appear, they tend to be mild: respiratory infection or fever. It is known, however, that the virus is spread from person to person, and not from an animal source. It has been suggested that this virus may be transmitted through respiratory fluids or urine, since infected individuals periodically excrete virus in the urine. This virus can be diagnosed by a BKV blood test or a urine test for decoy cells, in addition to carrying out a biopsy in the kidneys. PCR techniques are often carried out to identify the virus. Unfortunately, treatment options for BK virus infection are limited, and there is no effective prophylaxis. 

""BK Virus infections - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Acute Ischemic Stroke Understanding
Acute Ischemic Stroke: Overview
Acute Ischemic stroke results from a sudden cessation of adequate amounts of blood reaching parts of the brain. Ischemic strokes can be divided according to territory affected or mechanism. Clots are either thrombotic or embolic, depending on where they develop within the body. A thrombotic stroke, the more common of the two, occurs when a clot forms within an artery in the brain. An embolic stroke occurs when a clot or small piece of plaque (fatty deposit) breaks off from elsewhere in the body, such as the heart, and travels through the bloodstream only to become stuck in a narrower vessel in the brain. Symptoms depend on severity of the stroke and location in the brain. Some people do not experience any symptoms and others experience only one. Symptoms may include: Paralysis on one side of the body, Change in alertness, Changes in hearing or taste, Problems swallowing, Dizziness or loss of balance, and Problems with eyesight. Treatment consists of one or a combination of two basic approaches to restore proper blood flow: 1) an injection of a clot-busting drug and 2) mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure that physically removes clot from blocked arteries.

Vertigo Understanding
Vertigo: Overview
Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself. It's the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning. This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks. Attacks of vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds, or they may last much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making normal life very difficult. Vertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, although it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain. Some cases of vertigo improve over time, without treatment. However, some people have repeated episodes for many months, or even years, such as those with Ménière's disease. There are specific treatments for some causes of vertigo. A series of simple head movements (known as the Epley manoeuvre) is used to treat BPPV. Medicines, such as prochlorperazine and some antihistamines, can help in the early stages or most cases of vertigo.

""Vertigo - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Vertigo pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Vertigo treatment guidelines. The assessment part of the report embraces, in depth Vertigo commercial assessment and clinical assessment of the pipeline products under development.

This segment of the Vertigo report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Vertigo Emerging Drugs
• AM-125: Auris Medical
Auris Medical is developing AM-125, an intranasal formulation of betahistine, for the treatment of vertigo. The intranasal delivery of AM-125 is intended to bypass the effects of first-pass metabolism found with oral delivery of betahistine. This is expected to offer significant additional benefits in terms of efficacy and tolerability. Betahistine is a small molecule drug that acts as a partial histamine H1-receptor agonist and a H3-receptor antagonist. The compound has demonstrated increased cochlear, vestibular and cerebral blood flow, vestibular compensation and the ability to inhibit neuronal firing in the vestibular nuclei. In the case of vertigo, the objective is to restore balance. AM-125 is currently in Phase 2 development

• Seliforant: Sensorion
Seliforant (formerly SENS-111) is the first representative candidate of the histamine type 4 receptor antagonist class to be tested for the symptomatic treatment of vertigo crises. Displaying a neuromodulation effect of the sensorineural inner ear cell function, Seliforant is a small molecule that can be taken orally or via a standard injection, and is currently in a separate Phase 2 clinical trial.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa Understanding
Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Overview
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis majorly affecting areas of skin containing pilosebaceous glands. HS is also known as acne inversa or Verneuilles disease. The symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa ranges from mild to severe. It causes a mixture of boil-like lumps, blackheads, cysts, scarring and channels in the skin that leak pus. Smoking, obesity, and overweight are environmental risk factors in HS development. Diagnosis of Hidradenitis suppurativa is done through clinical features. The severity of the disease can be characterized on a number of scales, the most commonly used being the Hurley staging system. Management of Hidradenitis suppurativa includes topical and systemic therapies in addition to lifestyle advice and psychosocial modifications but often the disease will recur and treatment will need to be escalated. Several comorbidities have been associated with HS, most notably inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric diseases.

Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome Understanding
Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome: Overview
Tourette syndrome (TS) is a disorder that affects the body's brain and nervous system by causing tics — sudden, repetitive movements or sounds that some people make, seemingly without realizing it. A person with Tourette syndrome has mulitple motor tics and at least one vocal tic.  Tics are actually more common in teens than you might think. You may know someone who has either a motor tic (sudden, uncontrollable movements like exaggerated blinking of the eyes) or a vocal tic (sounds such as throat clearing, grunting, or humming). Tourette syndrome is a genetic disorder, which means it's the result of a change in genes that's either inherited (passed on from parent to child) or happens during development in the womb. As with other genetic disorders, someone may have a tendency to develop TS. But that doesn't mean the person will definitely get it.

""Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome Emerging Drugs
• Ecopipam: Emalex Biosciences
Ecopipam is an investigational first-in-class drug being evaluated in pediatric patients for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome (TS) and for childhood onset fluency disorder (Stuttering) in adults. Ecopipam selectively blocks the actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine at the D1 receptor. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its receptors have been classified into two “families” based on their genetic structure: “D1” (including subtypes D1 and D5) and “D2” (including subtypes D2, D3, and D4). D1-receptor super-sensitivity may be a mechanism for the repetitive and compulsive behaviors associated with Tourette Syndrome. The drug is currently in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome.

• THX-110: Therapix Biosciences
THX-110 is a drug candidate platform for the treatment of symptoms related to Tourette syndrome (TS), as well as Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and chronic pain. The drug is currently in phase 2 of clinical trials.

Tendinitis Understanding
Tendinitis: Overview

Tendinitis is an inflammation of a tendon, a group of sturdy fibers that connects a muscle to the nearby bone. Another commonly used term for tendinitis is tendinopathy. Tendinitis is generally caused by injury, trauma, or overuse of a joint. Tendinitis may be referred to by a more specific description depending on the location where it occurs, such as Achilles tendinitis or tennis elbow. The elbows, heel, shoulder and wrist are common locations for tendinitis. Tendinitis is treated with rest along with medications to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Physical therapy can be helpful to improve muscle strength and enhance healing. In some cases, surgery will need to be performed to repair tendon damage.

Middle East respiratory syndrome Understanding
Middle East respiratory syndrome: Overview
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lethal zoonotic severe lung infection caused by a legal pathogen Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012. Coronaviruses are large (28–32 kb) single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. To enter host cells, MERS-CoV attaches to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Pneumonia is common, and sometimes it cause injury to organs, such as the kidneys. Protease cleavage of the S protein is then required for virus–cell fusion and release of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Viral RNA transcription and replication occurs on double membrane vesicles and other membranous structures, which are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. MERS can be confirmed by detection of viral nucleic acid or by serology. The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed either by positive real-time reverse transcription PCR on at least two specific genomic targets or by a single positive target with sequencing of a second positive PCR product. No specific drug treatment exists for MERS and supportive treatment is the mainstay of management.

Sialorrhoea Understanding
Sialorrhoea: Overview
Sialorrhea, drooling or excessive salivation is a common problem in neurologically impaired children and in adults who have Parkinson's disease or have had a stroke. It is most commonly caused by poor oral and facial muscle control. Sialorrhea can lead to significant physical and psychosocial complications, including perioral chapping, dehydration, infection, foul odor, stigmatization, and increased dependency and level of care, all of which can create an additional burden for these medically complicated patients. Sialorrhea usually is caused by neuromuscular dysfunction, hypersecretion, sensory dysfunction, or anatomic (motor) dysfunction. The most common cause is neuromuscular dysfunction. Anterior sialorrhea is diagnosed by the observation of excessive drooling. Posterior sialorrhea can be suggested by the history of choking and repeated pneumonias. Treatment for Sialorrhea range from conservative (i.e., observation, postural changes, biofeedback) to more aggressive measures such as medication, radiation, and surgical therapy.

Adenovirus infections Understanding
Adenovirus infections: Overview
Adenoviruses are common viruses that cause a range of illness. They can cause cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and pink eye (conjunctivitis). Most adenovirus infections are mild with few symptoms. While each child may experience symptoms differently, the most common include: Respiratory infections, Intestinal tract infections. Adenoviruses are contagious, which means an individual can pass them on to the other. The type of infection determines how it spreads. A Physical exam is generally carried for the diagnosis of Adenovirus infections. Certain blood tests may be done to evaluate the infection. These include: blood test, stool test, urine test and swab test. Children often get over the illness on their own within a few days. Some infections, like pink eye or pneumonia, can last for a week or more.

Atherosclerosis Understanding
Atherosclerosis: Overview
Plaque (fatty deposits) build up in arteries is called atherosclerosis. These deposits are made up of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium and fibrin (a clotting material in the blood). As plaque builds up, the wall of the blood vessel thickens. This narrows the channel within the artery – reducing blood flow. Atherosclerosis is a slow, lifelong progression of changes in the blood vessels that may start in childhood and get worse faster with the age. Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause any symptoms until blood supply to an organ is reduced. When this happens, symptoms vary, depending on the specific organ involved: Heart — Symptoms include the chest pain of angina and shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness or light-headedness, breathlessness or palpitations. Brain — When atherosclerosis narrows brain arteries, it can cause dizziness or confusion; weakness or paralysis on one side of the body. Abdomen — When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries to the intestines, there may be dull or cramping pain in the middle of the abdomen. There is no cure for atherosclerosis, but treatment can slow or halt the worsening of the disease. The major treatment goal is to prevent significant narrowing of the arteries so that symptoms never develop and vital organs are never damaged.

Sleep apnoea syndrome Understanding
Sleep apnoea syndrome: Overview
Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep. There are two types of sleep apnea: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The more common of the two forms of apnea, it is caused by a blockage of the airway, usually when the soft tissue in the back of the throat collapses during sleep. Central sleep apnea: Unlike OSA, the airway is not blocked, but the brain fails to signal the muscles to breathe, due to instability in the respiratory control center. All three types of sleep apnea share certain common symptoms: Disrupted breathing in which a person’s respiration can become labored or even stop for up to a minute at a time, Excessive daytime sleepiness, Morning headaches, Irritability, and Limited attention span or difficulty thinking clearly. Treatment aims to normalize breathing during sleep and address any underlying health problems.

• AD128: Apnimed
AD128 incorporates a novel norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. The drug is being evaluated currently in Phase II/III clinical trials for sleep apnoea. The study will evaluate the combination of two drugs AD128 and mannitol, to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity.

• BAY2586116: Bayer
BAY2586116 is a new drug under development for the treatment of OSA. It blocks protein channels expressed on the surface of the upper airways in small mechanoreceptors (a type of molecule that sense and pass stimulus outside a cell on to the inside of the cell through mechanical gate on the surface of the cell). Thus the negative pressure reflex alerting the brain of inspiration is triggered more easily leading to a stronger activation of throat muscles. This prevents narrowing or collapse of the upper airways during sleep which is one of the pathological key factors in OSA.

Anti-CD20 antibody Understanding
Anti-CD20 antibody: Overview
CD20 is a 33- to 37-kDa non-glycosylated phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of mature undifferentiated B-cells. Expression starts at the pre–B-cell stage, and persists until terminal differentiation into plasma cells. This pattern, together with consistent and high levels of expression of CD20 on malignant B-cells, makes CD20 a therapeutic target. CD20 protein consists of four hydrophobic transmembrane domains, one intracellular and two extracellular domains (large and small loops) with both N- and C- termini residing within the cytosol. Expression of CD20 antigen by the most of transformed B cells is believed to be the driving force for targeting this molecule by using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used to achieve B cell depletion, and were initially developed to treat B cell proliferative disorders, including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Use of anti-CD20 therapy is vastly practiced to treat diseases with a high expression of CD20 antigen. Anti-CD20 antibodies are one of the most successful and effective antibodies which have employed in treatment of a wide range of diseases including cancer and immune related disorders.

""Anti-CD20 antibody - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Anti-CD20 antibody pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Anti-CD20 antibody treatment guidelines.

Anti-CD20 antibody Emerging Drugs
• Ublituximab: TG therapeutics
Ublituximab (TG-1101) is an investigational glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope on CD20-expressing B-cells. When ublituximab binds to the B-cell it triggers a series of immunological reactions (including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [ADCC] and complement dependent cytotoxicity [CDC]), leading to destruction of the cell. TG Therapeutics completes the rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting approval of ublituximab, the Company’s investigational glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody as a treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The U.S. FDA previously granted Fast Track designation to the combination of ublituximab and umbralisib (U2) for the treatment of adult patients with CLL and orphan drug designation for ublituximab in combination with umbralisib for the treatment of CLL.

• Glofitamab: Roche
Glofitamab (also known as RO7082859, RG6026) is an investigational, full-length, CD20- and CD3-targeting T-cell bispecific antibody that is designed to redirect T cells to engage and eliminate malignant B cells. Glofitamab is designed to bind to CD20, a B-cell surface protein expressed in a majority of B-cell malignancies, while simultaneously binding to CD3, a component of the TCR on the surface of T cells. A Phase III Study Evaluating Glofitamab in Combination With Gemcitabine + Oxaliplatin vs Rituximab in Combination With Gemcitabine + Oxaliplatin is underway in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.

Methylmalonic academia Understanding
Methylmalonic academia: Overview
Methylmalonic acidemia refers to a group of inherited conditions in which the body can’t breakdown certain parts of proteins and fats. This leads to a build-up of toxic substances and bouts of serious illness called decompensation events or metabolic crises. Symptoms of a decompensation event include poor feeding, vomiting, trouble breathing, and lack of energy (lethargy). These can occur at different ages and can range from mild to severe. Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by changes in several different genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Treatment includes aggressive management of decompensation events, a low-protein diet, certain medications, antibiotics and, in some cases, liver and kidney transplantation. Some subtypes of methylmalonic acidemia respond to vitamin B12. Long-term complications can include growth delay, intellectual disability, kidney disease, and pancreatitis. Methylmalonic acidemia can be isolated or may occur along with another condition called homocystinuria.

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Methylmalonic academia R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches for Methylmalonic acidemia.

Neutropenia Understanding
Neutropenia: Overview
Neutropenia is a blood condition characterized by low levels of neutrophils, which are white blood cells that protect your body from infections. There are four types of neutropenia: Congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, autoimmune neutropenia, Idiopathic neutropenia. Neutropenia symptoms can range from mild to severe. The lower the level of neutrophils, the more intense the symptoms. Typical symptoms include: fever, pneumonia, sinus infections, otitis media (ear infection), gingivitis (gum inflammation), omphalitis (navel infection) and skin abscesses. Severe congenital neutropenia can have serious symptoms. The symptoms often include bacterial infections. These infections can grow on the skin and in the digestive and respiratory systems. The symptoms of cyclic neutropenia recur in 3-week cycles. Infections can increase when neutrophil levels fall. Neutropenia can be triggered by: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, the use of certain drugs. 

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Neutropenia R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches for Neutropenia.

Neutropenia Emerging Drugs Chapters

It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Neutropenia Emerging Drugs
• Plinabulin: BeyondSpring Pharmaceuticals
Plinabulin, BeyondSpring’s lead asset, is a selective immune-modulating microtubule-binding agent (SIMBA). A global Phase 3 clinical trial in CIN (PROTECTIVE-2) with plinabulin in combination with pegfilgrastim versus pegfilgrastim alone has been completed and is the basis for an NDA filing in the U.S. and China for the prevention of CIN. In this trial, plinabulin reduced the “neutropenia vulnerability gap” associated with G-CSF therapy alone.
In March, 2021, BeyondSpring announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for use of plinabulin in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). 
• Romyelocel-L: Cellerant Therapeutics
Romyelocel-L, a composition of human myeloid progenitor cells, can be administered to provide a source of mature neutrophils and provide transient innate immunity until the patient’s own immune system recovers.
Romyelocel-L is being developed to prevent bacterial and fungal infections in patients with prolonged neutropenia. Romyelocel-L has been evaluated in three clinical trials to date. In a randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial (NCT02282215), romyelocel-L significantly reduced infections and days in hospital. Romyelocel-L has shown an acceptable safety profile in the three clinical trials, with a total of 151 subjects aged 12 years and above exposed to romyelocel-L.

Basal cell carcinoma Understanding
Basal cell carcinoma: Overview
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common, locally invasive, keratinocyte cancer (also known as nonmelanoma cancer). It is the most common form of skin cancer. BCC is also known as rodent ulcer and basalioma. The main characteristics are: Slowly growing plaque or nodule, Skin colored, pink or pigmented, Varies in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, Spontaneous bleeding or ulceration. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or from a tanning bed are the main cause of basal cell carcinoma. The goal of treatment for basal cell carcinoma is to remove the cancer completely. The clinical appearance, size, site, and histologic subtype determine choice of treatment: curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and photodynamic therapy, or, occasionally, radiation therapy. Large or recurrent basal cell cancers are treated best with Mohs' surgery (a specialized type of microscopically controlled surgery).

Chondrosarcoma Understanding
Chondrosarcoma: Overview
Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor composed of cartilage-producing cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone, and one of the most difficult bone tumors to diagnose and treat. They are most commonly found in older patients within the long bones and can arise de novo or secondary from an existing benign cartilaginous neoplasm. Symptoms of chondrosarcoma may vary depending on the location of the tumor. Patients usually present with pain, pathological fracture, a palpable lump or local mass effect. Hyperglycemia can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A bone tumor is often first diagnosed on x-ray after a physical examination. Additional tests, including a bone scan, CT scan, MRI and PET scan, can provide more information about the tumor. Ultimately, biopsy of the tumor is the way to make a definite diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. The treatment of conventional chondrosarcoma is surgical. The response of chondrosarcomas to chemotherapy and radiation therapy is limited. Physical therapy helps to regain strength and use of the affected area after surgery.

""Chondrosarcoma - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Chondrosarcoma pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Chondrosarcoma treatment guidelines.

Vasculitis Understanding
Vasculitis: Overview
Vasculitis is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and narrowing of blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries).  These vessels carry blood to and from the heart and the body’s organs.  Vasculitis occurs when the immune system mistakenly sees blood vessels as a foreign invader and attacks them. What causes this to happen isn't fully understood. These conditions can occur by themselves or with other rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE/ lupus) or Sjogrens syndrome. Other possible triggers include an infection (hepatitis B or C) or a medication side effect. Vasculitis also may be linked to certain blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma.

""Vasculitis - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

By precisely blocking the receptor (the C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, avacopan arrests the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The drug is in preregistration stage for the treatment of Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.

● Belimumab (Benlysta): GlaxoSmithKline
Benlysta, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble BLyS. Benlysta does not bind B cells directly. By binding BLyS, Benlysta inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. The drug is in phase 3 of clinical trials for the treatment of Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.

● Tocilizumab (Actemra): Roche
Actemra (tocilizumab) is a humanized anti IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody and binds specifically to IL-6 receptors. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The drug is registered for the treatment of vasculitis.

Narcolepsy Understanding
Narcolepsy: Overview
Narcolepsy is a disorder that disrupts sleep-wake processes. Its primary symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), which occurs because the brain is unable to properly regulate wakefulness and sleep1. The symptoms of narcolepsy can have notable effects during both daytime and night time. Narcolepsy is often caused by a lack of the brain chemical hypocretin (also known as orexin), which regulates wakefulness. Methods of diagnosing narcolepsy and determining its severity include: sleep history, sleep records, polysomnography. There is no cure for narcolepsy, but medications and lifestyle modifications can help to manage the symptoms.

Hepatic encephalopathy Understanding
Hepatic encephalopathy: Overview
Hepatic encephalopathy is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy differ depending on the underlying cause of the liver damage. There is no specific test used to diagnose hepatic Encephalopathy. A Hepatic Encephalopathy diagnosis is based on a combination of three things: medical history, symptoms, and a thorough clinical exam. Depending on the cause the treatment is aimed at lowering the level of ammonia and other toxins in your blood.

Herpes labialisUnderstanding
Herpes labialis: Overview
Herpes labialis or oral herpes is an infection of the mouth area that causes small, painful blisters to develop on the lips, gums or throat. These blisters are caused by the herpes simplex virus, a common and highly contagious virus that infects most people in the U.S by time they reach the age of 20. There are three stages of infection that occur in oral herpes, which include the primary infection, the latency period and recurrence. During the initial stage of infection, the virus enters the skin or mucosal membrane, where it then reproduces. Blisters and other symptoms such as fever may develop, although the virus sometimes does not cause any symptoms.

""Herpes labialis- Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Herpes labialis pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Herpes labialis treatment guidelines. The assessment part of the report embraces, in depth Herpes labialis commercial assessment and clinical assessment of the pipeline products under development. In the report, detailed description of the drug is given which includes mechanism of action of the drug, clinical studies, NDA approvals (if any), and product development activities comprising the technology, Herpes labial collaborations, licensing, mergers and acquisition, funding, designations and other product related details.

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Herpes labialisR&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches to treat/improve Herpes labialis.

This segment of the Herpes labialisreport encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Herpes labialis Emerging Drugs
• Pritelivir (AIC316): AiCuris
Pritelivir (AIC316) is a highly potent inhibitor of herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. Pritelivir belongs to a new chemical class and acts via a novel mechanism of action (inhibition of the viral helicase-primase enzyme complex). Due to this novel mechanism of action, and in contrast to the currently used nucleoside analogues, pritelivir does not require activation by viral enzymes and can thus protect uninfected cells. Pritelivir is active against herpes virus strains and retains activity against viruses which have become resistant to current standard drugs. In Phase 2 clinical trials, Pritelivir has shown superiority over the market standard treatment valacyclovir. Pritelivir is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for immunocompromised patients with acyclovir-resistant infection. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Herpes labialis.

• BTL-TML : Beech Tree Labs
In preclinical studies, BTL-TML interfered with the translation of proteins involved in viral replication and the structural integrity of infected cells (tubulin synthesis). In addition, genomic studies showed that BTL-TML downregulates several pro-inflammatory cytokine genes while up-regulating anti-inflammatory genes. Together, these effects could potentially limit the virus’s ability to reproduce, spread and cause overactive immune responses (cytokine storms) associated with poor outcomes. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Herpes labialis.
Further product details are provided in the report……..

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Understanding
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Overview
Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, liver inflammation and damage caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an umbrella term for a range of liver conditions. The more severe form of NAFLD is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH causes the liver to swell and become damaged.  When the buildup of fat causes inflammation and damage this can lead to the scarring of the liver. The main complication of NAFLD and NASH is cirrhosis, which is late-stage scarring in the liver. Cirrhosis occurs in response to liver injury, such as the inflammation in NASH. There is no standard treatment for patients NASH, lifestyle changes have been shown to affect its progression. This may include losing weight, maintaining a healthy diet, or addressing underlying conditions such as hypothyroidism and diabetes.

Myelofibrosis Understanding
Myelofibrosis: Overview
Myelofibrosis is a rare type of blood cancer in which the bone marrow (the soft, spongy tissue inside most bones) is replaced by fibrous scar tissue. It is considered a form of chronic leukemia. When myelofibrosis occurs on its own, it is called as primary myelofibrosis. If the disease occur as the result of a separate disease, it is known as secondary myelofibrosis. For e.g. scar tissue in the bone marrow as a complication of an autoimmune disease. One characteristic of myelofibrosis is the overproduction of giant cells called megakaryocytes. Tests and procedures used to diagnose myelofibrosis include: physical examination, blood tests, imaging tests, bone marrow examination, and gene tests to look for gene mutations in blood cells that are associated with myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis treatment usually depends on the types of symptoms. Many common Myelofibrosis symptoms are associated with an underlying condition caused by Myelofibrosis, such as anemia or an enlarged spleen. Enlarged spleen related to MF is treated with Radiation therapy, chemotherapy drugs, or surgery. Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 to treat the symptoms associated with MF.

Liposarcoma Understanding
Liposarcoma: Overview
Liposarcomas are rare type of malignant tumors of fatty tissue. They are the second most common type of soft-tissue sarcoma. Liposarcoma can occur in fat cells in any part of the body, but most cases occur in the muscles of the limbs or in the abdomen. Liposarcomas are typically found in adults, typically between the ages of 40 and 60, and are rare in children. Liposarcoma occurs more often in men than women. Liposarcoma risk factors may include radiation, family cancer syndromes, a damaged lymph system, and/or exposure to certain chemicals. Liposarcoma stages describe the extent of tumor spread with stage IV representing the most extensive cancer with metastatic spread. Liposarcoma can be diagnosed by imaging the body by X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therapy to treat liposarcoma largely depends on the type, size and location of the tumor. Treatments for liposarcoma include: Surgery, Radiation therapy, and Chemotherapy. New therapies are under clinical trials assessment as a potential treatment for liposarcomas.

Small Cell Lung Cancer Understanding
Small Cell Lung Cancer: Overview
 Small cell lung cancer accounts only for 13% of the lung cancers. However, SCLC is the more aggressive form of lung cancer. With SCLC, the cancer cells tend to grow quickly and travel to other parts of the body, or metastasize, more easily. Small cell lung cancer is more strongly linked to smoking. Small cell lung cancer typically have had relatively very few symptoms. The symptoms can result from local growth of the tumor, spread to nearby areas, distant spread, paraneoplastic syndromes, or a combination thereof. SCLC diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination and medical history. When SCLC reaches the extensive stage, treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, not at curing the disease.

Rosacea Understanding
Rosacea: Overview
Rosacea is a chronic skin disease that affects more than 16 million Americans. The cause of rosacea is still unknown, and there is no cure. However, research has allowed doctors to find ways to treat the condition by minimizing its symptoms. There are four subtypes of rosacea. Each subtype has its own set of symptoms. It is possible to have more than one subtype of rosacea at a time. Rosacea’s trademark symptom is small, red, pus-filled bumps on the skin that are present during flare-ups. Typically, rosacea affects only skin on your nose, cheeks, and forehead. Flare-ups often occur in cycles.

Carcinoid Syndrome Understanding
Carcinoid Syndrome: Overview
Carcinoid Syndrome, refers to the array of symptoms that occur secondary to carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid syndrome is seen in individuals who have an underlying carcinoid tumor with spread to the liver. Carcinoid tumors are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors with secretory properties, releasing serotonin, along with a number of other active peptides. These tumors can arise anywhere along the primitive gut and are therefore found in the bronchial tree (airways) and along the gastrointestinal tract. Only about 10% of the people with a carcinoid tumor will develop carcinoid syndrome. Only about 10% of the people with a carcinoid tumor develop carcinoid syndrome.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia Understanding
Primary ciliary dyskinesia: Overview
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is usually an autosomal recessive genetic condition in which the microscopic organelles (cilia) in the respiratory system have defective function. Ciliary dysfunction prevents the clearance of mucous from the lungs, paranasal sinuses and middle ears. Bacteria and other irritants in the mucous lead to frequent respiratory infections. Kartagener syndrome is a type of PCD associated with a mirror-image orientation of the heart and other internal organs (situs inversus). Rare cases of X-linked and autosomal dominant inheritance have been observed.

Presbyopia Understanding
Presbyopia: Overview
Presbyopia is the gradual loss of your eyes' ability to focus on nearby objects. Presbyopia is caused by a hardening of the lens of your eye, which occurs with aging. As the eye lens becomes less flexible, it can no longer change shape to focus on close-up images. As a result, these images appear out of focus. Some signs of presbyopia include holding reading materials at arm's length, blurred vision at normal reading distance and eye fatigue along with headaches when doing close work. Presbyopia is diagnosed by a basic eye exam, which includes a refraction assessment and an eye health exam. No cure exists for presbyopia. However, there are several treatments available to correct the vision. Depending on the condition and lifestyle, one can choose from corrective lenses, contact lenses, or surgery to correct the vision.

Ocular Hypertension Understanding
Ocular Hypertension: Overview
Ocular hypertension is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) without any evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. It is not a disease; however, increased eye pressure is the most important risk factor in the development of open angle glaucoma. Ocular hypertension can be categorized similarly to glaucoma with various possible mechanisms of etiology associated with an open or closed (or narrow) angle and associated primary or secondary causes. Ocular hypertension has no noticeable signs or symptoms. If the pressure is too high there may be pain on eye movement or touch. Diagnosis is usually done by a doctor of optometry who will measure your eye pressure and compare it to normal.

NCX 470 is designed to release both bimatoprost and NO following instillation into the eye. Currently, the drug is in phase 3 of development for the treatment of Ocular hypertension.

• AGN 193408: AbbVie
AGN-190584 is an investigational optimized formulation of pilocarpine, a cholinergic muscarinic receptor agonist, which activates muscarinic receptors located at smooth muscles such as the iris sphincter muscle and ciliary muscle and is being investigated for the treatment of presbyopia as a topical, once-daily drop delivered by a proprietary vehicle. The proposed mechanism of action of AGN-190584 is through contraction of the iris sphincter muscle, constricting the pupil to enhance the depth of focus and improve near and intermediate visual acuity while maintaining some pupillary response to light. AGN-190584 also contracts the ciliary muscle, facilitating accommodation. The drug is currently in phase I/II of clinical trials for the treatment of Ocular hypertension.

• Sepetaprost DE-126: Santen Pharmaceutical
A prostaglandin analogue eye drop drug product with a novel mode of action that is a dual agonist for both FP and EP3 receptors for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Started an additional Phase 2 in December 2020 in the U.S. Phase 2b completed in Japan.

Muscle spasticity Understanding
Muscle spasticity: Overview
When the muscles contract, become stiff, or spasm involuntarily, it’s called spasticity. Spasticity occurs when the nerve impulses that control muscle movement are interrupted or damaged. Signs and symptoms may include: muscle tightness, joint stiffness, muscle spasms, back pain, abnormal positioning of fingers, wrists, arms, or shoulders and others. The main cause of spasticity is damage to the nerve pathways that control muscle movement. If spasticity is not properly managed, it can result in frozen joints and pressure sores on the skin. Treatment is based on the frequency and level of spasticity, and the underlying condition that’s causing it.

Gaucher’s Disease Understanding
Gaucher’s Disease: Overview
Gaucher disease is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder in which deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase results in the accumulation of harmful quantities of certain fats (lipids), specifically the glycolipid glucocerebroside, throughout the body especially within the bone marrow, spleen and liver. The symptoms and physical findings associated with Gaucher disease vary greatly from patient to patient. Gaucher disease is categorized as a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Lysosomes are the major digestive units in cells. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or ""digest"" nutrients, including certain complex carbohydrates and fats.

Gastroesophageal Reflux disease Understanding
Gastroesophageal Reflux disease: Overview
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet). It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the causes of GORD. GORD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth. It may just be an occasional nuisance for some people, but for others it can be a severe, lifelong problem.

Ataxia telangiectasia Understanding
Ataxia telangiectasia: Overview
Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. The disease is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood. Affected children typically develop difficulty in walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. A diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests including blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and karyotyping. Treatment for AT is directed toward control of symptoms. For respiratory infections, therapy with an antibiotic drug, postural drainage (with the head lower than the rest of the body) of the bronchial tubes and lungs, and gammaglobulin injections in some cases may be effective.

Hepatitis C Understanding
Hepatitis C: Overview
Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, long-term illness. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contaminated blood. The hepatitis C virus is a blood borne virus, the most common modes of infection are through exposure to small quantities of blood. This may happen through injection drug use, unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. Hepatitis C is often described as “acute,” meaning a new infection, or “chronic,” meaning long-term infection. Chronic hepatitis C can be a serious disease resulting in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-colored faeces, joint pain and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). Treatments for hepatitis C includes antivirals, like medications called direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) work to fully remove the hepatitis C virus from the body while helping prevent liver damage.

Glioblastoma Understanding
Glioblastoma: Overview
 Glioblastoma, also known as Glioblastoma Multiforme is a fast growing glioma that develops from star shaped glial cells (astrocytes) that supports the health of nerve cells in the brain. A grading system from I to IV defines the rate of tumor growth grade I indicating slow growth and grade IV indicating rapid growth. The exact cause of glioblastoma is unknown. However, there are factors that can influence the risk of glioblastoma.  Suspected individuals with glioblastoma undergoes physical and neurological examination. Sophisticated imaging techniques can very accurately pinpoint the location of brain tumors. Diagnostic tools include computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treating glioblastoma is difficult due to several complicating factors. Treatment options include a combination of surgery, radio therapy, chemotherapy, and alternating electric fields therapy.

Keloids Understanding
Keloids: Overview
Keloids are raised overgrowths of scar tissue that occur at the site of a skin injury. They occur where trauma, surgery, blisters, vaccinations, acne or body piercing have injured the skin. Keloid scars tend to be larger than the original wound itself. They are shiny, smooth and rounded skin elevations that may be pink, purple, or brown. Most types of skin injury can contribute to keloid scarring. Keloids should not be confused with hypertrophic scars, which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound and may reduce over time. A dermatologist diagnoses a keloid on the basis of its appearance and a history of tissue injury, such as surgery, acne or body piercing. Available treatments include: Removal with conventional surgery, Dressings, Corticosteroid injections, Compression, Cryosurgery, Radiation therapy, Laser therapy, and Fluorouracil injections.

""Keloids - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Keloids pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Keloids treatment guidelines.

Keloids Emerging Drugs
• STP705: Sirnaomics
STP705 is a siRNA (small interfering RNA) therapeutic that takes advantage of the Company's proprietary dual-targeted inhibitory property and polypeptide nanoparticle (PNP)-enhanced delivery to directly knock down both TGF-β1 and COX-2 gene expression. The potential drug is in clinical studies for the treatments of Cholangiocarcinoma, Non-Melanoma skin cancer and Hypertrophic Scar. For Keloids, the drug is undergoing Phase I clinical evaluation.

• Remlarsen: miRagen Therapeutics
Remlarsen is a synthetic molecule designed to mimic the activity of a natural molecule called microRNA-29. Abnormally low levels of microRNA-29 are believed to contribute to excessive scar tissue formation. miRagen believes that treatment of a skin wound with remlarsen may reduce the formation of scar tissue and may potentially prevent or reduce the growth of keloids in individuals with a tendency for keloid formation.

Hemochromatosis Understanding
Hemochromatosis: Overview
Hemochromatosis is a disorder in which extra iron builds up in the body to harmful levels. Without treatment, hemochromatosis can cause iron overload, a buildup of iron that can damage many parts of the body, including your liver, heart, pancreas, endocrine glands, and joints. There are two forms of hemochromatosis: primary and secondary. Primary hemochromatosis, also known as hereditary hemochromatosis, usually results from genetic factors. Secondary hemochromatosis occurs when a buildup of iron stems from another medical condition, such as erythropoietic hemochromatosis. Diagnosis for hemochromatosis is based on blood tests to check levels of iron and certain proteins in the blood and to check for gene mutations that commonly cause hemochromatosis. Treatment of hemochromatosis is done with phlebotomy, or drawing about a pint of blood at a time, on a regular schedule. Another option is chelation. This is a developing therapy that can help manage iron levels, but it is expensive and not a first-line treatment option.

""Hemochromatosis - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Hemochromatosis pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Hemochromatosis treatment guidelines.

Osteonecrosis Understanding
Osteonecrosis: Overview
Osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis (AVN), aseptic necrosis or ischemic bone necrosis, is a disease resulting in the death of bone cells. The amount of disability that results from osteonecrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected, how large an area is involved, how far the disease has progressed. Commonly involved bones are the upper femur (ball part of the hip socket) the lower femur (a part of the knee joint), the upper humerus (upper arm bone involving the shoulder joint), and the bones of ankle joint. There are two general categories of osteonecrosis: traumatic (following an injury) and non-traumatic. Diagnosis of the condition is done through X-rays, and magnetic resonance imaging.  Often, treatment starts with pain medications and by limiting weight-bearing (such as walking) on affected areas. This type of conservative treatment may work well for patients with early osteonecrosis in small areas of bone. Patients whose osteonecrosis is getting worse may need a procedure called core decompression. It removes a piece (core) of bone from the affected area, to try to improve blood flow.

Mydriasis Understanding
Mydriasis: Overview
 Mydriasis is the medical term for an unusual dilation or widening of the pupils. This may be caused by an injury, psychological factors, or due to the uptake of certain drugs or medications. The characteristic symptom of mydriasis is dilated pupils that do not get bigger or smaller in response to changes in light. When the pupils are dilated, the eyes become more sensitive to light. This can lead to blurry vision, as well as, in some cases, a general feeling of constriction around the forehead and eyes.  Treatment approaches try to protect the full functionality of the eyes and generally depends on what caused the condition in first.

Recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas Understanding
Recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas: Overview
Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare malignant brain tumor. Astrocytomas are tumors that develop from certain star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. Astrocytomas come in four grades based upon how fast the cells are reproducing and that likelihood that they will spread (infiltrate) nearby tissue. The symptoms of anaplastic astrocytoma vary depending upon the exact location and size of the tumor. Symptoms commonly associated with anaplastic astrocytomas include headaches, lethargy or drowsiness, vomiting, and changes in personality or mental status. The exact cause of anaplastic astrocytomas is unknown. Researchers speculate that genetic and immunologic abnormalities, environmental factors (e.g., exposure to ultraviolet rays, certain chemicals, and ionizing radiation), diet, stress, and/or other factors may play contributing roles in causing specific types of cancer.

Acute optic neuritis Understanding
Acute optic neuritis: Overview
Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve and is frequently the presenting sign of multiple sclerosis. These patients commonly experience pain on eye movement and then suddenly have a major loss in visual acuity, usually in one eye. The blindness often resolves in 6-8 weeks. Six months after the episode of blindness, more than half of the patients have some visual changes, including deficits in color vision, contrast sensitivity, and light brightness. The current treatment is steroids, which reduce the period of visual acuity loss but have little or no effect on the preventing damage to contrast vision.

Peritoneal Cancer Understanding
Peritoneal Cancer: Overview
Peritoneal cancer is is a rare form of cancer affecting the peritoneum, the thin membrane surrounding your abdominal organs. The causes of peritoneal cancer are unknown. Primary peritoneal cancer is more common in women than in men. The symptoms of peritoneal cancer resemble those of ovarian cancer.

● Ganaxolone: Marinus Pharmaceuticals
 Ganaxolone is a GABAA receptor modulator that acts by regulating brain activity. GABA is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Ganaxolone binds to one of the receptor subtypes, the GABAA receptor. When this receptor is activated, it increases the movement of chloride ions through a pore on the cell surface. This action changes the positive and negative charges inside and outside the cell, which inhibits the firing of the neuron. The drug is being evaluated in phase II stage for the treatment of Tuberous sclerosis.

Cerebral Infarction Understanding
Cerebral Infarction: Overview
Infarction refers to death of tissue. A cerebral infarction also known as ischemic stroke, or stroke, is a brain lesion in which a cluster of brain cells die when they don't get enough blood. A lack of adequate blood supply to brain cells deprives them of oxygen and vital nutrients which can cause parts of the brain to die off. The reduced blood supply to the brain is caused by atherosclerosis which gives rise to the formation of a fatty plaque in the blood vessel called an atheroma. Symptoms and signs of a stroke: difficulty speaking, difficulty understanding or confusion, especially with simple tasks, difficulty with muscle strength, especially on one side of the body, severe headache and vision changes.

Adalimumab Understanding
Adalimumab: Overview
Adalimumab, sold under the brand name Humira among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It works by blocking a protein (tumor necrosis factor or TNF) found in the body's immune system that causes joint swelling and damage in arthritis as well as red scaly patches in psoriasis. Adalimumab belongs to a class of drugs known as TNF blockers. By reducing joint swelling, this medication helps to reduce further joint damage and preserve joint function. After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in levels of acute phase reactant proteins of inflammation (C­ reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was measured compared to baseline in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

Adalimumab Biosimilars: Marketed Drugs
• Abrilada: Pfizer
Abrilada is an FDA-approved biosimilar version of adalimumab. Abrilada (adalimumab-afzb) injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous administration. The drug product is supplied as either a single-dose prefilled pen (Abrilada pen), as a single-dose 1 mL prefilled glass syringe, or as a single-dose institutional use vial. Enclosed within the pen is a single-dose 1 mL prefilled glass syringe. Though approved, it is not yet marketed in the US like several other manufacturers of approved biosimilar versions of adalimumab, Pfizer has signed a licensing agreement with AbbVie; under the agreement, Samsung would be able to launch the drug in November 2023.

• Halimatoz: Sandoz
Halimatoz is mostly used in adults when their conditions are severe, moderately severe or getting worse, or when patients cannot use other treatments. Halimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab and is a ‘biosimilar medicine’. The active substance in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and attach to a substance in the body called tumour necrosis factor (TNF). TNF is involved in causing inflammation and is found at high levels in patients with the diseases that Halimatoz is used to treat. By attaching to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases.

Pheochromocytoma Understanding
Pheochromocytoma: Overview
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that usually starts in the cells of one of your adrenal glands. It results in the release of too much epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. Pheochromocytoma may occur as a single tumor or as more than one growth. It usually develops in the center (medulla) of one or both adrenal glands. Symptoms associated with pheochromocytomas include high blood pressure (hypertension), headaches, excessive sweating, and/or heart palpitations. In approximately 25 to 35 percent of cases, pheochromocytomas may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Blood and urine analysis can confirm a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma by detecting elevated levels of catecholamines or its metabolites in the urine and blood (plasma). Phenoxybenzamine or a similar drug is generally given to stop hormone action. The most common surgical procedure for treating pheochromocytoma is laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Radiation therapy, in which radiation is used to target and destroy cancer cells, and certain combinations of anticancer drugs (chemotherapy) may also be used to treat individuals with malignant pheochromocytoma.

""Pheochromocytoma - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Pheochromocytoma pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Pheochromocytoma treatment guidelines.

The drug is in Phase II clinical studies for the treatment of Pheochromocytoma.

• Guadecitabine: Astex Pharmaceuticals
Guadecitabine is a next-generation DNA hypomethylating agent. Guadecitabine is rationally designed to be resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase, prolonging the exposure of tumor cells to the active metabolite, decitabine, thus ensuring greater uptake of decitabine into the DNA of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Guadecitabine-mediated inhibition of DNA methylation upregulates tumor-associated antigens and may sensitize tumor cells to other anticancer agents, including immunotherapeutics, as well as resensitize resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. The drug is in Phase II clinical evaluation for the treatment of Pheochromocytoma.

Meniere’s Disease Understanding
Meniere’s Disease: Overview
Meniere’s disease is a chronic condition that affects the inner ear. The disease is characterized by episodic vertigo attacks, fluctuating hearing loss that becomes permanent over time, tinnitus, and a feeling of ear fullness. The cause of Meniere's disease is unknown. Meniere’s disease usually affects only one ear. Attacks of dizziness may come on suddenly or after a short period of tinnitus or muffled hearing. Some people will have single attacks of dizziness separated by long periods of time. People with Meniere's can experience a feeling of pressure in the ear, sudden dizzy spells, tinnitus, muffled hearing or hearing loss. The symptoms of Meniere’s disease are caused by the buildup of fluid in the compartments of the inner ear, called the labyrinth. Although Meniere's disease can affect people of any age, people in their 40s and 50s are much more likely to experience it. A series of diagnostic tests can be done to check the balance and hearing. These include: Audiometric exam, electronystagmogram, electrocochleography, and auditory brainstem response test among others. No cure exists for Meniere's disease. A number of treatments can help reduce the severity and frequency of vertigo episodes.

Scleroderma Understanding
Scleroderma: Overview
Scleroderma is a group of rare diseases that involve the hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues. Scleroderma affects women more often than men and most commonly occurs between the ages of 30 and 50. While there is no cure for scleroderma, a variety of treatments can ease symptoms and improve quality of life. There are many different types of scleroderma. In some people, scleroderma affects only the skin. But in many people, scleroderma also harms structures beyond the skin, such as blood vessels, internal organs and the digestive tract (systemic scleroderma). Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. There are 2 main types of scleroderma: localised scleroderma – just affects the skin and systemic sclerosis – may affect blood circulation and internal organs as well as the skin.

Cystinuria Understanding
Cystinuria: Overview
Cystinuria is a rare genetic disorder that causes a buildup of an amino acid called cystine in the urine. This can result in the formation of cystine kidney stones. Cystine stones are often larger, harder and form more frequently than other kinds of kidney stones. Due to the larger stone size, cystine stones may be more difficult to pass, often requiring surgical procedures to remove. Stones can create blockages in the urinary tract and reduce the ability of the kidneys to eliminate waste through urine. The stones also provide sites where bacteria may cause infections. Signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the presence of stones and may include blood in the urine, flank pain, and frequent urinary tract infections.

Lupus Nephritis Understanding
Lupus Nephritis: Overview
Lupus nephritis is glomerulonephritis caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Clinical findings include hematuria, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and, in advanced stages, azotemia. Diagnosis is based on renal biopsy. Treatment is of the underlying disorder and usually involves corticosteroids and cytotoxic or other immunosuppressant drugs. Lupus nephritis is diagnosed in about 50% of patients with SLE and typically develops within 1 year of diagnosis. However, the total incidence is probably > 90%, because renal biopsy in patients with suspected SLE without clinical evidence of renal disease shows changes of glomerulonephritis (GN).

Lupus Nephritis Emerging Drugs
• Obinutuzumab: Roche
Obinutuzumab (RG7159, GA101) is the first glycoengineered, type II, humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It has a distinct mode of action compared with other anti-CD20s, including MabThera/Rituxan, and was specifically designed to selectively target the CD20 protein on B cells and to bind with high affinity to the cell surface in a type II configuration. The drug is in phase 3 of clinical trials for the treatment of Lupus Nephritis.

• Narsoplimab: Omeros Corporation
Narsoplimab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2), the effector enzyme of the lectin pathway of the complement system. The lectin pathway is one of the principal pathways of complement and is activated primarily by tissue damage and microbial infection. Importantly, inhibition of MASP-2 does not appear to interfere with the classical complement pathway, a critical component of the acquired immune response to infection. This novel, proprietary drug is designed to prevent complement-mediated inflammation and endothelial damage while leaving intact the respective functions of the other pathways of innate immunity. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Lupus Nephritis.

Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: Overview
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease predominantly affecting middle-aged women. It is hypothesized that PBC begins with loss of immune self tolerance, leading to damage of the biliary epithelial cells of small bile ducts. Ongoing immunologic events perpetuate the biliary epithelial cell destruction via direct cytotoxicity or lymphokine-mediated cell damage, leading to disease progression. PBC is most commonly diagnosed after the age of 40 years. Of patients with PBC, 90% are women

Endometrial Cancer Understanding
Endometrial Cancer: Overview
Endometrial cancer is cancer of the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. It is the most common type of cancer that affects the female reproductive organs. The most common type of endometrial cancer (type 1) grows slowly. It most often is found only inside the uterus. Type 2 is less common. It grows more rapidly and tends to spread to other parts of the body. Endometrial cancer occurs when the cells of the endometrium start to grow too rapidly. The lining of the uterus may thicken in certain places. These areas of thickness may form a mass of tissue called a tumor. Cancer cells also can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.

Anal Cancer Understanding
Anal Cancer: Overview
Anal cancer is a rare condition, although its incidence has been increasing over the past several decades, particularly in women. The majority of anal cancers are squamous cell cancers and are linked with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Many anal cancers are found early because they are in a location that your physician can easily see and reach. Diagnosis is often made when people with any of the above symptoms undergo an anal exam. Anal cancer may also be found incidentally during yearly physical exams that include a digital rectal exam. The rectal exam is performed to check the rectum, prostate or other pelvic organs. Anal cancers can also be found when a person has a preventive colorectal screening test (such as a colonoscopy).

Anal Cancer Emerging Drugs
• Atezolizumab: Genentech
Atezolizumab blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and CD80 receptors (B7-1Rs).[16] PD-L1 can be highly expressed on certain tumors, which is thought to lead to reduced activation of immune cells (cytotoxic T-cells in particular) that might otherwise recognize and attack the cancer.[16] Inhibition of PD-L1 by atezolizumab can remove this inhibitor effect and thereby engender an anti-tumor response. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of anal cancer,

• Avelumab: Merck KGaA
Avelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Avelumab has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, avelumab has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models. The drug is in phase I/II of clinical trials for the treatment of anal cancer.

Adrenocortical Carcinoma Understanding
Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Overview
Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease. It is caused by a cancerous growth in the adrenal cortex, which is the outer layer of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands lie on top of the kidneys. They play an important role in the endocrine system, which is the system that produces and regulates hormones. ACC is also known as adrenocortical carcinoma. The adrenal cortex makes hormones that regulate metabolism and blood pressure. It also produces cortisol and the male hormones called androgens, such as testosterone. ACC may trigger excessive production of these hormones.

• Relacorilant: Corcept Therapeutics
Relacorilant is a non-steroidal, selective modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor, the receptor for cortisol which is activated when cortisol levels are high. Relacorilant does not bind to the body's other hormone receptors. Corcept is studying relacorilant as a potential treatment for a variety of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome and advanced adrenal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. 

• Ipilimumab: Bristol-Myers Squibb
Yervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Adrenocortical carcinoma.

Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells. In this the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells that crowd out the normal healthy blood cells. Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia is considered a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's is also sometimes called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.  Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia is slow growing and may not cause signs and symptoms for many years. When they occur the symptoms may include: easy bruising, fatigue, weight loss, fever, numbness in hands and feet’s, change in vision and shortness of breath. What causes Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia is still not clear. The disease generally begins with one abnormal white blood cell that develops errors (mutations) in its genetic code.

Wilson ’s disease Understanding
Wilson ’s disease: Overview
Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excess copper stored in various body tissues, particularly the liver, brain, and corneas of the eyes. The disease is progressive and, if left untreated, it may cause liver (hepatic) disease, central nervous system dysfunction, and death. Common signs of associated liver disease include a yellow discoloration (jaundice) of the skin, mucous membranes and the membranes (sclera) that line the eye, swelling (edema) of the legs and abdomen (ascites). Wilson disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Wilson disease is caused by disruption or changes (mutations) of the ATP7B gene, which plays an important role in the movement of excess copper from the liver to the bile to eventually be excreted from the body through the intestines. Treatment for Wilson disease is life-long and aimed at lowering copper levels to nontoxic levels, and at preventing the progression of the disease and trying to reverse any signs and symptoms that have appeared because of copper accumulation in the body.

Acute Liver Failure Understanding
Acute Liver Failure: Overview
Acute liver failure is an uncommon condition in which rapid deterioration of liver function results in coagulopathy. Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that occurs rapidly — in days or weeks. Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including excessive bleeding and increasing pressure in the brain. Signs and Symptoms of Acute liver failure include: pain in right abdomen, yellowing of skin, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness and disorientation of confusion.

Vasculitis Understanding
Vasculitis: Overview
Vasculitis involves inflammation of the blood vessels. The inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken, which reduces the width of the passageway through the vessel. If blood flow is restricted, it can result in organ and tissue damage. Vasculitis can affect people at any age. Some forms affect blood vessels that go to or supply specific organs like your skin, eyes, or brain. Vasculitis can have general symptoms like fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Treatment depends on what’s causing your vasculitis and which organs are affected. Corticosteroid medications, also known as steroids, are generaaly preferred to fight inflammation.

The main characteristics are: Slowly growing plaque or nodule, Skin colored, pink or pigmented, Varies in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, Spontaneous bleeding or ulceration. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or from a tanning bed are the main cause of basal cell carcinoma. The goal of treatment for basal cell carcinoma is to remove the cancer completely. The clinical appearance, size, site, and histologic subtype determine choice of treatment: curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and photodynamic therapy, or, occasionally, radiation therapy. Large or recurrent basal cell cancers are treated best with Mohs' surgery (a specialized type of microscopically controlled surgery).

Chondrosarcoma Understanding
Chondrosarcoma: Overview
Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor composed of cartilage-producing cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone, and one of the most difficult bone tumors to diagnose and treat. They are most commonly found in older patients within the long bones and can arise de novo or secondary from an existing benign cartilaginous neoplasm. Symptoms of chondrosarcoma may vary depending on the location of the tumor. Patients usually present with pain, pathological fracture, a palpable lump or local mass effect. Hyperglycemia can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A bone tumor is often first diagnosed on x-ray after a physical examination. Additional tests, including a bone scan, CT scan, MRI and PET scan, can provide more information about the tumor. Ultimately, biopsy of the tumor is the way to make a definite diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. The treatment of conventional chondrosarcoma is surgical. The response of chondrosarcomas to chemotherapy and radiation therapy is limited. Physical therapy helps to regain strength and use of the affected area after surgery.

Vasculitis Understanding
Vasculitis: Overview
Vasculitis is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and narrowing of blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries).  These vessels carry blood to and from the heart and the body’s organs.  Vasculitis occurs when the immune system mistakenly sees blood vessels as a foreign invader and attacks them. What causes this to happen isn't fully understood. These conditions can occur by themselves or with other rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE/ lupus) or Sjogrens syndrome. Other possible triggers include an infection (hepatitis B or C) or a medication side effect. Vasculitis also may be linked to certain blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma.

Vasculitis Emerging Drugs
? Avacopan : ChemoCentryx
Avacopan is a first-in-class, orally-administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis and other complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. By precisely blocking the receptor (the C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, avacopan arrests the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The drug is in preregistration stage for the treatment of Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.

? Belimumab (Benlysta): GlaxoSmithKline
Benlysta, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble BLyS. Benlysta does not bind B cells directly. By binding BLyS, Benlysta inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. The drug is in phase 3 of clinical trials for the treatment of Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.

? Tocilizumab (Actemra): Roche
Actemra (tocilizumab) is a humanized anti IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody and binds specifically to IL-6 receptors. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The drug is registered for the treatment of vasculitis.

The symptoms of narcolepsy can have notable effects during both daytime and night time. Narcolepsy is often caused by a lack of the brain chemical hypocretin (also known as orexin), which regulates wakefulness. Methods of diagnosing narcolepsy and determining its severity include: sleep history, sleep records, polysomnography. There is no cure for narcolepsy, but medications and lifestyle modifications can help to manage the symptoms.

Hepatic encephalopathy: Overview
Hepatic encephalopathy is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy differ depending on the underlying cause of the liver damage. There is no specific test used to diagnose hepatic Encephalopathy. A Hepatic Encephalopathy diagnosis is based on a combination of three things: medical history, symptoms, and a thorough clinical exam. Depending on the cause the treatment is aimed at lowering the level of ammonia and other toxins in your blood.

Herpes labialisUnderstanding
Herpes labialis: Overview
Herpes labialis or oral herpes is an infection of the mouth area that causes small, painful blisters to develop on the lips, gums or throat. These blisters are caused by the herpes simplex virus, a common and highly contagious virus that infects most people in the U.S by time they reach the age of 20. There are three stages of infection that occur in oral herpes, which include the primary infection, the latency period and recurrence. During the initial stage of infection, the virus enters the skin or mucosal membrane, where it then reproduces. Blisters and other symptoms such as fever may develop, although the virus sometimes does not cause any symptoms.

It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Herpes labialis Emerging Drugs
• Pritelivir (AIC316): AiCuris
Pritelivir (AIC316) is a highly potent inhibitor of herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. Pritelivir belongs to a new chemical class and acts via a novel mechanism of action (inhibition of the viral helicase-primase enzyme complex). Due to this novel mechanism of action, and in contrast to the currently used nucleoside analogues, pritelivir does not require activation by viral enzymes and can thus protect uninfected cells. Pritelivir is active against herpes virus strains and retains activity against viruses which have become resistant to current standard drugs. In Phase 2 clinical trials, Pritelivir has shown superiority over the market standard treatment valacyclovir. Pritelivir is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for immunocompromised patients with acyclovir-resistant infection. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Herpes labialis.

• BTL-TML : Beech Tree Labs
In preclinical studies, BTL-TML interfered with the translation of proteins involved in viral replication and the structural integrity of infected cells (tubulin synthesis). In addition, genomic studies showed that BTL-TML downregulates several pro-inflammatory cytokine genes while up-regulating anti-inflammatory genes. Together, these effects could potentially limit the virus’s ability to reproduce, spread and cause overactive immune responses (cytokine storms) associated with poor outcomes. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Herpes labialis.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Understanding
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Overview
Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, liver inflammation and damage caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an umbrella term for a range of liver conditions. The more severe form of NAFLD is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH causes the liver to swell and become damaged.  When the buildup of fat causes inflammation and damage this can lead to the scarring of the liver. The main complication of NAFLD and NASH is cirrhosis, which is late-stage scarring in the liver. Cirrhosis occurs in response to liver injury, such as the inflammation in NASH. There is no standard treatment for patients NASH, lifestyle changes have been shown to affect its progression. This may include losing weight, maintaining a healthy diet, or addressing underlying conditions such as hypothyroidism and diabetes.

Myelofibrosis Understanding
Myelofibrosis: Overview
Myelofibrosis is a rare type of blood cancer in which the bone marrow (the soft, spongy tissue inside most bones) is replaced by fibrous scar tissue. It is considered a form of chronic leukemia. When myelofibrosis occurs on its own, it is called as primary myelofibrosis. If the disease occur as the result of a separate disease, it is known as secondary myelofibrosis. For e.g. scar tissue in the bone marrow as a complication of an autoimmune disease. One characteristic of myelofibrosis is the overproduction of giant cells called megakaryocytes. Tests and procedures used to diagnose myelofibrosis include: physical examination, blood tests, imaging tests, bone marrow examination, and gene tests to look for gene mutations in blood cells that are associated with myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis treatment usually depends on the types of symptoms. Many common Myelofibrosis symptoms are associated with an underlying condition caused by Myelofibrosis, such as anemia or an enlarged spleen. Enlarged spleen related to MF is treated with Radiation therapy, chemotherapy drugs, or surgery. Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 to treat the symptoms associated with MF.

Liposarcoma Understanding
Liposarcoma: Overview
Liposarcomas are rare type of malignant tumors of fatty tissue. They are the second most common type of soft-tissue sarcoma. Liposarcoma can occur in fat cells in any part of the body, but most cases occur in the muscles of the limbs or in the abdomen. Liposarcomas are typically found in adults, typically between the ages of 40 and 60, and are rare in children. Liposarcoma occurs more often in men than women. Liposarcoma risk factors may include radiation, family cancer syndromes, a damaged lymph system, and/or exposure to certain chemicals. Liposarcoma stages describe the extent of tumor spread with stage IV representing the most extensive cancer with metastatic spread. Liposarcoma can be diagnosed by imaging the body by X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therapy to treat liposarcoma largely depends on the type, size and location of the tumor. Treatments for liposarcoma include: Surgery, Radiation therapy, and Chemotherapy. New therapies are under clinical trials assessment as a potential treatment for liposarcomas.

Small Cell Lung Cancer Understanding
Small Cell Lung Cancer: Overview
 Small cell lung cancer accounts only for 13% of the lung cancers. However, SCLC is the more aggressive form of lung cancer. With SCLC, the cancer cells tend to grow quickly and travel to other parts of the body, or metastasize, more easily. Small cell lung cancer is more strongly linked to smoking. Small cell lung cancer typically have had relatively very few symptoms. The symptoms can result from local growth of the tumor, spread to nearby areas, distant spread, paraneoplastic syndromes, or a combination thereof. SCLC diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination and medical history. When SCLC reaches the extensive stage, treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, not at curing the disease.

Rosacea Understanding
Rosacea: Overview
Rosacea is a chronic skin disease that affects more than 16 million Americans. The cause of rosacea is still unknown, and there is no cure. However, research has allowed doctors to find ways to treat the condition by minimizing its symptoms. There are four subtypes of rosacea. Each subtype has its own set of symptoms. It is possible to have more than one subtype of rosacea at a time. Rosacea’s trademark symptom is small, red, pus-filled bumps on the skin that are present during flare-ups. Typically, rosacea affects only skin on your nose, cheeks, and forehead. Flare-ups often occur in cycles.

Carcinoid Syndrome: Overview
Carcinoid Syndrome, refers to the array of symptoms that occur secondary to carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid syndrome is seen in individuals who have an underlying carcinoid tumor with spread to the liver. Carcinoid tumors are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors with secretory properties, releasing serotonin, along with a number of other active peptides. These tumors can arise anywhere along the primitive gut and are therefore found in the bronchial tree (airways) and along the gastrointestinal tract. Only about 10% of the people with a carcinoid tumor will develop carcinoid syndrome. Only about 10% of the people with a carcinoid tumor develop carcinoid syndrome.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia Understanding
Primary ciliary dyskinesia: Overview
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is usually an autosomal recessive genetic condition in which the microscopic organelles (cilia) in the respiratory system have defective function. Ciliary dysfunction prevents the clearance of mucous from the lungs, paranasal sinuses and middle ears. Bacteria and other irritants in the mucous lead to frequent respiratory infections. Kartagener syndrome is a type of PCD associated with a mirror-image orientation of the heart and other internal organs (situs inversus). Rare cases of X-linked and autosomal dominant inheritance have been observed.

Presbyopia Understanding
Presbyopia: Overview
Presbyopia is the gradual loss of your eyes' ability to focus on nearby objects. Presbyopia is caused by a hardening of the lens of your eye, which occurs with aging. As the eye lens becomes less flexible, it can no longer change shape to focus on close-up images. As a result, these images appear out of focus. Some signs of presbyopia include holding reading materials at arm's length, blurred vision at normal reading distance and eye fatigue along with headaches when doing close work. Presbyopia is diagnosed by a basic eye exam, which includes a refraction assessment and an eye health exam. No cure exists for presbyopia. However, there are several treatments available to correct the vision. Depending on the condition and lifestyle, one can choose from corrective lenses, contact lenses, or surgery to correct the vision.

Ocular hypertension can be categorized similarly to glaucoma with various possible mechanisms of etiology associated with an open or closed (or narrow) angle and associated primary or secondary causes. Ocular hypertension has no noticeable signs or symptoms. If the pressure is too high there may be pain on eye movement or touch. Diagnosis is usually done by a doctor of optometry who will measure your eye pressure and compare it to normal.

Muscle spasticity Understanding
Muscle spasticity: Overview
When the muscles contract, become stiff, or spasm involuntarily, it’s called spasticity. Spasticity occurs when the nerve impulses that control muscle movement are interrupted or damaged. Signs and symptoms may include: muscle tightness, joint stiffness, muscle spasms, back pain, abnormal positioning of fingers, wrists, arms, or shoulders and others. The main cause of spasticity is damage to the nerve pathways that control muscle movement. If spasticity is not properly managed, it can result in frozen joints and pressure sores on the skin. Treatment is based on the frequency and level of spasticity, and the underlying condition that’s causing it.

Gaucher’s Disease Understanding
Gaucher’s Disease: Overview
Gaucher disease is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder in which deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase results in the accumulation of harmful quantities of certain fats (lipids), specifically the glycolipid glucocerebroside, throughout the body especially within the bone marrow, spleen and liver. The symptoms and physical findings associated with Gaucher disease vary greatly from patient to patient. Gaucher disease is categorized as a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Lysosomes are the major digestive units in cells. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or ""digest"" nutrients, including certain complex carbohydrates and fats.

Ataxia telangiectasia Understanding
Ataxia telangiectasia: Overview
Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. The disease is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood. Affected children typically develop difficulty in walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. A diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests including blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and karyotyping. Treatment for AT is directed toward control of symptoms. For respiratory infections, therapy with an antibiotic drug, postural drainage (with the head lower than the rest of the body) of the bronchial tubes and lungs, and gammaglobulin injections in some cases may be effective.

Hepatitis C Understanding
Hepatitis C: Overview
Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, long-term illness. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contaminated blood. The hepatitis C virus is a blood borne virus, the most common modes of infection are through exposure to small quantities of blood. This may happen through injection drug use, unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. Hepatitis C is often described as “acute,” meaning a new infection, or “chronic,” meaning long-term infection. Chronic hepatitis C can be a serious disease resulting in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-colored faeces, joint pain and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes).

Glioblastoma Understanding
Glioblastoma: Overview
 Glioblastoma, also known as Glioblastoma Multiforme is a fast growing glioma that develops from star shaped glial cells (astrocytes) that supports the health of nerve cells in the brain. A grading system from I to IV defines the rate of tumor growth grade I indicating slow growth and grade IV indicating rapid growth. The exact cause of glioblastoma is unknown. However, there are factors that can influence the risk of glioblastoma.  Suspected individuals with glioblastoma undergoes physical and neurological examination. Sophisticated imaging techniques can very accurately pinpoint the location of brain tumors. Diagnostic tools include computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treating glioblastoma is difficult due to several complicating factors. Treatment options include a combination of surgery, radio therapy, chemotherapy, and alternating electric fields therapy.

Keloids Understanding
Keloids: Overview
Keloids are raised overgrowths of scar tissue that occur at the site of a skin injury. They occur where trauma, surgery, blisters, vaccinations, acne or body piercing have injured the skin. Keloid scars tend to be larger than the original wound itself. They are shiny, smooth and rounded skin elevations that may be pink, purple, or brown. Most types of skin injury can contribute to keloid scarring. Keloids should not be confused with hypertrophic scars, which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound and may reduce over time. A dermatologist diagnoses a keloid on the basis of its appearance and a history of tissue injury, such as surgery, acne or body piercing. Available treatments include: Removal with conventional surgery, Dressings, Corticosteroid injections, Compression, Cryosurgery, Radiation therapy, Laser therapy, and Fluorouracil injections.

""Keloids - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Hemochromatosis Understanding
Hemochromatosis: Overview
Hemochromatosis is a disorder in which extra iron builds up in the body to harmful levels. Without treatment, hemochromatosis can cause iron overload, a buildup of iron that can damage many parts of the body, including your liver, heart, pancreas, endocrine glands, and joints. There are two forms of hemochromatosis: primary and secondary. Primary hemochromatosis, also known as hereditary hemochromatosis, usually results from genetic factors. Secondary hemochromatosis occurs when a buildup of iron stems from another medical condition, such as erythropoietic hemochromatosis. Diagnosis for hemochromatosis is based on blood tests to check levels of iron and certain proteins in the blood and to check for gene mutations that commonly cause hemochromatosis. Treatment of hemochromatosis is done with phlebotomy, or drawing about a pint of blood at a time, on a regular schedule. Another option is chelation. This is a developing therapy that can help manage iron levels, but it is expensive and not a first-line treatment option.

Osteonecrosis Understanding
Osteonecrosis: Overview
Osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis (AVN), aseptic necrosis or ischemic bone necrosis, is a disease resulting in the death of bone cells. The amount of disability that results from osteonecrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected, how large an area is involved, how far the disease has progressed. Commonly involved bones are the upper femur (ball part of the hip socket) the lower femur (a part of the knee joint), the upper humerus (upper arm bone involving the shoulder joint), and the bones of ankle joint. There are two general categories of osteonecrosis: traumatic (following an injury) and non-traumatic. Diagnosis of the condition is done through X-rays, and magnetic resonance imaging.  Often, treatment starts with pain medications and by limiting weight-bearing (such as walking) on affected areas. This type of conservative treatment may work well for patients with early osteonecrosis in small areas of bone. Patients whose osteonecrosis is getting worse may need a procedure called core decompression. It removes a piece (core) of bone from the affected area, to try to improve blood flow.

Mydriasis Understanding
Mydriasis: Overview
 Mydriasis is the medical term for an unusual dilation or widening of the pupils. This may be caused by an injury, psychological factors, or due to the uptake of certain drugs or medications. The characteristic symptom of mydriasis is dilated pupils that do not get bigger or smaller in response to changes in light. When the pupils are dilated, the eyes become more sensitive to light. This can lead to blurry vision, as well as, in some cases, a general feeling of constriction around the forehead and eyes.  Treatment approaches try to protect the full functionality of the eyes and generally depends on what caused the condition in first.

Recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas Understanding
Recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas: Overview
Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare malignant brain tumor. Astrocytomas are tumors that develop from certain star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. Astrocytomas come in four grades based upon how fast the cells are reproducing and that likelihood that they will spread (infiltrate) nearby tissue. The symptoms of anaplastic astrocytoma vary depending upon the exact location and size of the tumor. Symptoms commonly associated with anaplastic astrocytomas include headaches, lethargy or drowsiness, vomiting, and changes in personality or mental status. The exact cause of anaplastic astrocytomas is unknown. Researchers speculate that genetic and immunologic abnormalities, environmental factors (e.g., exposure to ultraviolet rays, certain chemicals, and ionizing radiation), diet, stress, and/or other factors may play contributing roles in causing specific types of cancer.

Acute optic neuritis Understanding
Acute optic neuritis: Overview
Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve and is frequently the presenting sign of multiple sclerosis. These patients commonly experience pain on eye movement and then suddenly have a major loss in visual acuity, usually in one eye. The blindness often resolves in 6-8 weeks. Six months after the episode of blindness, more than half of the patients have some visual changes, including deficits in color vision, contrast sensitivity, and light brightness.

Cerebral Infarction Understanding
Cerebral Infarction: Overview
Infarction refers to death of tissue. A cerebral infarction also known as ischemic stroke, or stroke, is a brain lesion in which a cluster of brain cells die when they don't get enough blood. A lack of adequate blood supply to brain cells deprives them of oxygen and vital nutrients which can cause parts of the brain to die off. The reduced blood supply to the brain is caused by atherosclerosis which gives rise to the formation of a fatty plaque in the blood vessel called an atheroma. Symptoms and signs of a stroke: difficulty speaking, difficulty understanding or confusion, especially with simple tasks, difficulty with muscle strength, especially on one side of the body, severe headache and vision changes.

"Advanced Wound Care (AWC) Market Insights, Competitive Landscape and Market Forecast–2026",,120,Pharma & Healthcare,"DelveInsight’s ‘Advanced Wound Care (AWC) -Market Insights, Competitive Landscape and Market Forecast-2026’ report delivers an in-depth understanding of advanced wound care and the historical and forecasted advanced wound care market trends in the US, EU5 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France and United Kingdom) and Japan.
 
 The advanced wound care market report provides an overview of advanced wound care, applications of advanced wound care as well as its PEST Analysis. Additionally, the report provides insight on the AWC market share of the individual AWC devices, current and forecasted AWC market size from 2018 to 2026 segmented by seven major markets. The report also covers the market drivers, market barriers and unmet medical needs to curate best of the opportunities and assesses underlying potential of the market.
 
 Advanced Wound Care Overview
 The rising demand for acute wound care products in the market is majorly due to the increasing acute and chronic disorders. The traditional forms of wound care products are not only ineffective in treating chronic wounds but also involve a steady process of healing, hence, there is a huge demand for these products within the market. Owing to the prolonged treatment process that chronic wounds need and the cost incurred during the treatment, advanced wound care products definitely hold an upper edge. Apart from this, there are several other reasons why advanced wound care products are extremely beneficial in treatment of acute and chronic wounds. This involves maintaining a hydrating environment at the wound site, preventing any sort of exogenous infection, maintaining a continued flow of oxygen etc. AWC products are an alternative to the traditional wound care products, majorly designed for people suffering from wounds that are caused due to diabetes or ulcers. AWC products form a major ratio for treatment of complicated external wounds in hospitals and clinics. As more and more traditional wound care products are fading out, the manufacturers are trying to develop advanced forms of wound care products with greater efficiency and fast healing properties.
 Diabetes is a chronic condition and leads to formation of diabetic foot ulcers, which may turn out to be infectious. Advanced care products are therefore made to ease the suffering of patients dealing with such forms of chronic conditions. They are also used in the treatment of pressure ulcers, extremely prevalent in the North American region. AWC products would include hydrogels, hydrocolloids, alginates, films and foam dressings. Seaweed extracted alginate is available in a variety of shapes to cover the wounded site and eliminate the bacteria. Hydrocolloid dressings would have hydrophilic substances like gelatin and cellulose, which intake all the bacteria, dirt and fluids from the wound.

 Biliary Stents Overview
 A common disorder that can result from malignant or benign diseases is obstructive jaundice. Surgery was the main treatment for biliary obstruction cases prior to endoscopic biliary stenting, which was implemented in the early 1980s. Whipple procedure with hepaticojejunostomy, cholecystojejunostomy, choledochojejunostomy, or other procedures according to the predisposing condition were surgical options for obstructive jaundice. Biliary stents have been successfully used to restore the consistency of disrupted segmental branches at the level of the main hepatic confluence and for leaks from aberrant bile ducts. The primary therapeutic objective of major biliary injury with bile leakage is to circumvent the leak with the stent to redirect bile flow to the duodenum and convert an acute therapeutic target if there is no transection.
 About two decades ago, the use of plastic biliary stents for bile duct drainage was defined and plastic stents are now used for a number of therapeutic indications in the biliary tree. Pancreatic disease applications have also been developed. These stents are used for malignant and benign cases, and the decompression of the biliary tree has been proven effective and secure. Biliary stent palliative insertion relieves distal biliary obstruction as efficiently as surgical bypass.
 There have been continued advances in terms of therapeutic endoscopy via endoscopic stenting, especially in the area of device designing and insertion techniques. Due to these advancements, the clinicians are now easily progressing to provide lumen-to lumen anchoring and in reducing the bilio-pancreatic leakages. 
 
 How are Biliary Stents inserted?
 Biliary stent is seen to be effectively useful in the treatment of a range of pancreatico-biliary diseases. The patients undergo a procedure known as the Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) for the insertion of a biliary stent in the bile duct. The ERCP composes of a flexible tube which has a camera attached to it on one end and the tube is made to be passed down the throat of the person to his stomach. The inside picture of the stomach can be seen over the screen. The biliary stent is inserted in to the bile duct by the help of a wire. When the position of the biliary stent is proper, the wire can be taken out. The bile duct should be able to drain the fluids in an effective manner after the procedure is done. The whole procedure takes about 30- 40 min on an average. For some people the procedure performed is different, also known as the Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiogram (PTC). 
 
 Risks associated with the procedure
 Although a metal stent incorporated into the bile duct, helps in effective passage of the fluids like bilirubin, however there might be certain risks/complications that can take place eventually after the insertion of the Metal based biliary stent. These include stent occlusion, tumor overgrowth around the stent, tumor ingrowth around the stent, fever, bleeding, nausea, inflammation, pain, jaundice etc.

 Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) Overview
 Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely used to provide renal support for patients with acute renal damage who are critically ill, particularly hemodynamically unstable patients. A range of methodologies, including continuous venovenous hemofiltration with predominantly convective fluid clearance, continuous venovenous hemodialysis with predominantly diffusive solvent clearance, and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration which combines both dialysis and hemofiltration, can be used that vary in their mode of solvent clearance. 
 In critically ill patients, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication and is associated with severe morbidity and death risk. During their ICU stay, about 5 to 10% of AKI patients need renal replacement therapy (RRT) with mortality rates of 30 to 70%. The incidence of RRT-requiring AKI has increased by approximately 10% per year over the past 2 decades.
 Although initially designed as an arteriovenous therapy, pump-driven venovenous extracorporeal circuits are now used to conduct most CRRTs. The pump-driven venovenous circuit offers higher and more stable blood flows and removes the risks associated with prolonged arterial cannulation with a large-bore catheter, although this adds additional degrees of sophistication, including pressure sensors and air detectors. Multiple methods have been developed to deliver CRRT.
 
 CRRT Machines- Operation mechanism
 In case of the commonly used filter configurations, the patient’s blood enters into the filter passing through the hollow tubules, which span the entire length of the filter. The microtubules comprise of a semi-permeable membrane, allowing solute and fluid exchange in between the two different sides of the membrane, assuring that the blood is not mixed with the other side of the membrane that has the fluid. The metabolic waste and the excess fluid travels from the blood side of the membrane and goes onto the fluid side of the membrane and the physiologic electrolytes can be further made to travel from the fluid side of the membrane to the blood end of the membrane, in cases where a low concentration of electrolytes is present in the blood. Finally, all the treated blood travels from the filter and is returned to the patient.

 Defibrillator Overview
 Defibrillation is used for patients suffering from life threatening conditions which affect the heart’s rhythm such cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillators help in delivering an electrical shock or send an electrical impulse to the heart, thus causing depolarization of the heart muscles and maintaining the normal conduction of the heart’s impulse. They can also be used to restore the heartbeat incase the heart stops functioning.
 The market for defibrillators in rising with the increasing cases of arrhythmia due to high prevalence of heart diseases, ageing population, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc. Defibrillators can prevent sudden death among people who have a high risk of a life-threatening arrhythmia. 
 These are different Type of defibrillators that are used to assist people in case of a sudden cardiac arrest or arrhythmia. Automated Cardioverter Defibrillator is a light-weight, battery operated and portable device that works by checking the rhythm of the heart and sends a shock to the heart in order to restore the normal heartbeat. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators are used in patients suffering from cardiac, which obstruct the flow of the blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Therefore, the device is surgically implanted in the chest/ abdomen that can send a shock to correct arrhythmia. Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillators have sensors attached with the skin. These are connected by the help of wires to a unit which keeps a check on the rhythm of the heat and corrects it by sending a shock.

 Holter Monitor Understanding 
 Holter Monitor Overview
 With the rising prevalence of Cardiovascular Diseases worldwide, new and innovative devices are being developed, and there is a surge in the demand for enhanced monitoring devices. A Holter monitor is a small, battery-incorporated device that measures the activities of the heart including heart rates and heart rhythms. The device can be useful for continuous monitoring of heart activity in high risk population. Apart from the heart rate and the heart rhythm, the device is also capable of picking up chest pains, irregular heartbeats or arrhythmia. The Holter monitor is also called as the ambulatory electrocardiography. Although the device has electrodes and electrical leads attached with the device exactly like the electrocardiogram, it can record the heart's activity throughout the period that it is worn for unlike the electrocardiogram that records activity only for a few minutes. The cardiac symptoms and other components of heart rhythm irregularities are not permanent and therefore continuous monitoring is required to record such events taking place. The recordings captured by the HM give an idea if the patient’s heart is getting proper amount of oxygen and if the electrical impulses in the heart and early or a bit delayed.

 Left Atrial Appendage Closure Devices: Overview 
 The Left Atrial Appendage is a small ear-shaped structure found in the muscular wall of the left atrium. In case of a normal heart, the heart shows contraction with every heartbeat and the blood from the left atrium and the Left atrial appendage (LAA) comes out of the left atrium and moves into the left ventricle. When the person suffers from atrial fibrillation, the electrical impulses do not migrate in a continuous fashion. Instead a number of impulses initiate at the same time and are spread throughout the atria. The speeding impulses do not provide enough time to the atria in order to contract effectively and pass their blood to the ventricles. Because the LAA forms a sac shaped structure the blood collects and clot formation take place in both the LAA and the atria. Post-formation of clots, they are pumped out of the heart leading to a stroke.

 Lumbar Disk Replacement Overview
 A Lumbar Disc replacement (LDR) is a kind of surgery which takes place in the back region or in the spine. The spine is composed of bones also known as the vertebrae, which are placed on top of one another. The discs present in between these vertebrae act like cushions allowing the rotation of the vertebrae and its seamless movement without the bones rubbing off each other. The lumbar vertebrae and the discs are present at the bottom most region of the spine. The lumbar disk replacement elucidates the replacement of the lumbar disc with an artificial form of the lumbar disc made of metal alone or a combination of both metal and plastic. The Lumbar disc replacement procedure ensures minimization of pain, removing instability and tension caused in the muscles due to the smaller motions at the degenerated disc level. 
 
 How does a Lumbar Disc replacement take place?
 The procedure involves an IV line into the arm area or the vein of the patient from which an anesthetic is given. The team of surgeons help together in performing the procedure. The surgeons incise the abdominal area and all the organs and the blood vessels will be moved aside, allowing direct access to the spine. The surgeons then replace the damaged disc/symptomatic lumbar disc with the artificial lumbar disc, placing back the organs and the blood vessels in position and closing the incision that was made earlier. The patient is then taken to the recovery area for a closer analysis until they wake up from the anesthesia. The patient would continue to have an IV line and a catheter to continue his urination process. 
 
 Reasons to get a Lumbar Disc Replacement
 The main reason as to why a person would go for a Lumbar Disc Replacement is mainly because of the lower back pain. However, there are certain limitations in terms of the patients who can go forward with a lumbar disc replacement. People who can be recommended with this treatment are as follows:
 • If the back pain is majorly because of 1 or 2 disks of the lower spine area.
 • The patient does not have any major joint diseases or compression on the nerves of the spine.
 • The patient is not overweight.
 • There was no previous spinal injury.
 • The patient does not have scoliosis or any other kind of spinal deformity.

 Sacral Nerve Stimulator Overview
 Sacral nerve stimulation, also known as the sacral neuromodulation comprises of implantation of the stimulator surgically, that sends across low-voltage electrical signals to the sacral nerves. The location of the sacral nerve is at the bottom of the spine, and is responsible for the bladder, bowl as well as the pelvic floor. The implantation of the stimulator helps in turn in the stimulation of the sacral nerve thus easing the fecal or the urinary incontinence. A hand-operated device helps to stop the contractions made in the sphincter muscles, in case of a need to empty out the bowels.
  The sacral nerve stimulators are recommended for patients suffering from urinary and fecal incontinence, an overly active urinary bladder with a continuous urge to urinate, patients suffering from chronic constipation who have tried every form of treatment and have failed with those in the past. The device can be effectively used in improving the quality of life by improving the ability of the patient to delay the emptying of bowels and reduce the number of times in terms of bowel incontinence.
 
  How is the Sacral Nerve Stimulator implanted?
 The sacral nerve stimulators can be implanted by the help of a two-phase procedure. In the first phase, the surgeon implants the stimulator device under the skin. This is also known as the test phase. After the implantation of the device under the skin, the patient maintains a record of the bowel and the urinary activity, approving of the device’s positive effects. After the test phase which lasts for about two-four days, the patients are implanted with the sacral nerve stimulator device for a prolonged term. The strength of the electrical pulse can be controlled and altered using a remotely-controlled device. The sacral nerve stimulation can be stopped at any given point of time, without damaging the nerves permanently. However, in cases where the battery power becomes less, the surgeon replaces it with another sacral nerve stimulator device.

 Pulse oximeters Overview
 Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive and painless test that measures oxygen saturation level, or the oxygen levels in blood. It can rapidly detect even small changes in how efficiently oxygen is being carried to the extremities furthest from the heart, including the legs and the arms. Pulse oximeters in hospice and palliative care are mainly used to maintain patient comfort and to improve the quality of life, to aid conventional treatment, especially in case of pulmonary fibrosis. To calculate the amount of oxygen and heart rate, these instruments use infrared light. These devices are essential in any setting in which a patient's blood oxygen levels requires monitoring like operations, emergency and intensive care, and treatment and recovery in hospital wards.

 Blood Pressure monitoring Devices Overview
 Blood pressure monitoring device is a device used to monitor the patient's blood pressure. Using a sphygmomanometer, or blood pressure monitor, blood pressure is measured. It is made up of an inflatable cuff wrapped around the arm, approximately level with the heart, and a measuring system that monitors the pressure of the cuff. Two pressures are measured by the monitor: systolic and diastolic. Systolic pressure is higher as the heart pumps and moves blood into the arteries, and when the heart rests and fills with blood, diastolic pressure is calculated.

 Blood Glucose monitoring systems Overview
 The quantity of sugar present in the blood sample is determined by a small instrument called a glucose metre or glucometer. Throughout the day and night, continuous glucose monitoring automatically tracks blood glucose levels, also called blood sugar. A Continous Glucose Monitor operates, typically under the skin on the belly or arm, by a tiny sensor implanted . Interstitial glucose content, which is the glucose present in the fluid between the cells, is measured by the sensor. It is critically used by diabetic patients in order to measure their glucose level regularly to avoid hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

 Cardiac Monitoring Devices Overview
 Clinicians use cardiac monitoring devices, which are important for cardiovascular care, to assess the occurrence and seriousness of cardiac failure and to evaluate the success of therapies such as medications, procedures, device implants. Worldwide, the main cause of death is cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is possible to avoid most forms of CVDs by pre-monitoring and pre-diagnosis. Likewise, with early diagnosis, irregularities in the functioning of the heart, termed arrhythmias, can be prevented. As a result, the market for CM products is rising as these devices help to save patients at high risk for heart disease. Family background, age & ethnicity are some of the prime risk factors for CVD. Consumption of cigarettes, elevated blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, unhealthy diets and alcohol consumption are several risk factors.

Structural Heart Devices (SHD) Overview
Structural Heart Devices are referred to as the heart abnormalities that result due to excessive wear and tear or heart defects that the person is born with. For instance, the leaky or tight heart valves due to heart’s wear and tear whereas a hole observed in the chambers of the heart would be a birth defect. The heart valve disease id the most common structural heart defect observed in people.
The structural heart diseases are one of the most researched and a growing field seen in the field of cardiovascular medicines. The incredible advancements made in this field have helped effectively in treating the structural heart defects with simplicity and safety for patients. the open-heart surgeries that involve high amounts of risks have been reduced vehemently to minimally invasive procedures which are less-time consuming, involves lesser risks, speedy recovery post treatment procedures etc. the procedures involve heart valve repair and replacement, which can be performed by the help of small tubes known as catheters. 
Catheter Based Structural Heart Procedures
The structural heart disease treatments are done with the help of small tubes called as catheters. The catheters are hollow-shaped and allow different types of instruments to pass across the heart and delivered at the treatment site. For example, in cases of a diseased heart valve, a new valve is made to be passed from the catheter at the valve site and is secured in that location. Owing to the technology, the valves are made to be passed through the catheter in a compressed state and are expanded once they reach their correct location, making the valve a fully functional valve.

 Tissue Heart Valves / Cardiovascular Prosthetic Devices Overview
 Mechanical heart valve is an artificial heart valve implanted in the patient suffering from diseases such as aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation. Patients implanted with these devices do not require anticoagulation medication for a long time. Major advantages of tissue heart valves involve easy tolerance by the body and an average life expectancy of more than 15 years. However, their drawback is their durability only up to 10 to 20 years, thereby creating the need for a second replacement surgery.

 Dry Powder Inhaler Devices Overview
 The dry powder inhaler is a medical device that is used to administer medicine efficiently to the lungs. The drug comes in dry powder form. Patients with multiple respiratory disorders use dry powder inhalers because they 
 are compact and simple to transport. Owing to increasing incidences of asthma, lung diseases, and increasing contamination due to the high discharge of toxic chemicals, the increasing demand for dry powder inhaler (DPI) 
 devices may be mainly attributed. These instruments are not immune to moisture and thus, once the drug comes into contact with moisture, it loses its properties. Also, the presence of other competing goods on the market, 
 such as electric pumps and nebulizers, are the reasons that limit the development of the market.

 Cardiac Ablation Devices Overview
 Cardiac ablation is a surgical technique that can correct cardiac arrhythmias by scarring tiny regions of the heart. Cardiac arrythmias arise where there is a deficiency of the electrical impulses that regulate the heartbeats. As a consequence, heartbeats are irregular and can lead to stroke or heart failure if left untreated, and are one of the main causes of death. The global demand for cardiac ablation devices is projected to record significant growth due to a rise in the geriatric population and an increase in the cardiovascular disease population base.

 Total Artificial Heart Overview
 Artificial hearts are used to assist people with utter heart failure to live normal lives beyond their life expectancy time line, or to assist patients to survive by either removing the heart entirely or replacing the ventricles before their transplant date. To aid in the functioning of a failing heart, the unit is surgically inserted in the chest. An artificial heart may also be used temporarily, and if the heart begins working properly, it is disabled. In situations where the damage is serious, the artificial heart is completely replaced by the biological heart. Either compressed air or electricity is operated by an artificial heart. The growth in the number of cardiac diseases is projected to push the artificial heart market in the coming years, along with an increase in the geriatric population. It is anticipated that inappropriate lifestyle, leading to declining heart condition, would provide artificial heart producers with growth opportunities. However in the medical field, they only have to achieve noticeable momentum, with implantation being performed in a limited subset of patients needing transplantation.

Viscosupplementation Devices Overview
Viscosupplementation is a method by which liquid greasing is infused into a joint to promote better joint development, reduce torment, and decrease osteoarthritis movement. Viscosupplementation is a new medical notion that has the restoration of rheological homeostasis in pathological structures such as osteoarthritic joints as its therapeutic objective. When, under pathological conditions, the normal viscoelasticity of a solid tissue compartment or the elastoviscosity of a liquid tissue compartment is reduced, normal functioning and regenerative processes are impaired. The normal rheological condition of such compartments is restored or augmented by the introduction of viscosupplementary devices. Depending on the nature of the viscous supplement and the pathophysiology of the tissue compartment, these devices remain in the tissue compartment for different periods of time.

The report also covers the market drivers, market barriers and unmet medical needs to curate best of the opportunities and assesses underlying potential of the market.
 
Insulin Delivery Devices Overview
Insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar, plays a crucial function in diabetic therapy. As a result of its absolute deficiency, all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus require insulin. With overall survival in patients with type 2, they will need insulin due to gradual ?-cell loss. While insulin is the most effective therapeutic option available to manage hyperglycemia, diabetes patients face multiple difficulties, including, but not limited to, everyday life, financial restrictions, regimen difficulty, injection pain, and public humiliation when initiating and adhering to insulin therapy. These delivery devices assist in the secretion of insulin under the skin into the fatty tissue. It is also known that obesity is a significant cause contributing to the growth of diabetes in persons. 
Addressing these hurdles with innovative and efficient insulin delivery systems is thus necessary in order to prevent diabetes-related complications.

Insulin delivery systems are available in many different types, including syringes, pens, jet injectors, oral insulin, and pumps.
Consumer development is led by the rise in the prevalence of diabetic population. Portability, ergonomic nature, further favor the future development of the industry because of their ease of use.

 Trauma Devices Overview
Trauma refers to any form of physical damage caused by any external source, such as fractures, dislocations, sprains & strains and burns. Metallic plates, screws, and intramedullary nails are used to temporarily knit broken or dislocated bones or hallux valguses in trauma devices. Following fusion, they are removed.The consistent rise of digital technology is one of the main drivers of the demand for trauma products. It is expected that the rise in the geriatric population will increase the incidence of degenerative bone diseases worldwide, thereby driving the market for trauma products.  Allergies and diseases once inserted, such as eczematous dermatitis, hives, and vasculitis, may be caused by items containing or made of metals. Osteolysis, discomfort and aseptic loosening of embedded metal hardware are also caused by metal sensitivity.

Transcatheter Embolization And Occlusion Devices Overview
In interventional radiology, transcatheter embolization and occlusion (TEO) is a minimally invasive (MI) treatment in which a synthetic embolus is positioned or implanted into the blood vessel via a fine catheter to block the flow of blood to the tumour or to other areas of the body. Growing burden of targeted diseases, technical advancements in efficiency-enhanced systems, moving from clipping to coiling, increasing demand for minimally invasive surgeries (MISs), and increasing penetration of TEO devices are some of the major factors driving market development. The most prominent of all vascular abnormalities are venous malformations.  It is expected that the high cost of products and the existence of a rigid regulatory system for product commercialization would hinder growth.

 Spinal Cord Stimulators (SCS) Overview
 Spinal cord stimulation device consists of thin wire, which carries out current from pulse generator to nerve fibres of the spinal cord. These are mounted under the skin and transmit electrical signal to the spinal cord. This system is made up of a short wire that brings current to the nerve fibres of the spinal cord from a pulse generator. Therefore, machines for spinal cord stimulation help minimise discomfort due to electrical pulses and mask the signal of pain from affecting the brain. The key factor boosting growth is the rise in the number of patients with failed back syndrome, chronic pain, and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).

 Spinal Fusion Devices Overview
 A spinal fusion device is an orthopedic surgical instrument which is used to keep in place or join two or more vertebrae. They consist of interbody devices, biologics, cervical fixation devices, and thoracolumbar fixation devices. A rapidly growing global geriatric population would be a key force driving this market. Aged people are particularly vulnerable to different forms of injury thereby spiking the demand for spinal arthrodesis devices in the long-run. However it is expected that an adverse reimbursement outcome and a strict regulatory approval process for these products would restrict market development.

Interbody Cages Overview
The Interbody Fusion Cage is an implantable surgical device that is used to preserve the spine's total height. When the gap between the discs is changed, interbody fusion cages are inserted between the spinal cords. Materials such as titanium, carbon fibre, or allograft femur are used to form these interbody fusion cages. Growth of the market is led by an increase in the geriatric population and an increase in the occurrence of spinal injury and sports injuries. Furthermore these devices benefit physcians by allowing them to to decompress nerves directly and rebuild the spine further which fuels the growth of the market. However the market development is limited by high costs associated with spinal fusion procedures, shortage of qualified practitioners as well as rigid guidelines and regulations regarding the use of these instruments.

Cranio Maxillofacial Fixation (CMF) Devices Overview
Orthopaedic instruments Cranio Maxillo Facial (CMF) include fixation devices for cranial and maxillofacial bone fractures. Maxillofacial injuries include injuries to the facial skeleton and facial soft tissue. Some of the key factors driving global demand growth are the rise in the number of sport-related incidents, crashes from high ground, face injuries incurred by road collisions, crime, assaults, and motor vehicle accidents. In addition, rising patient and healthcare provider demand for minimally invasive craniomaxillofacial surgery would increase market revenue. When undertaking replacement operations, minimally invasive surgical techniques provide many advantages. The benefits of smoother regeneration and healing, reduced blood loss and suffering, and shorter hospital stays will accelerate the development of the sector. The important limiting factor for the industry is the absence of reimbursement policies for many of the craniomaxillofacial fixation products. Frequent product recalls have also been found to hamper the market's overall performance. The recall of goods has a detrimental impact on the company and credibility of a manufacturer.

Positive Airway Pressure Device Overview
In the treatment of choice for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems are used. By blowing air into the nose and the lungs, CPAP works. The blow allows the upper airway to stay open during sleep under positive pressure and thereby aids in the treatment of snoring. The growth of the industry has been fueled by advancements in technologies such as improved mask design, oral equipment, the use of oxygen products, growing healthcare spending, and increasing demand for devices. However because some patients find it unpleasant and often it shows adverse effects, CPAP is not always successful. The high cost of the devices and their adverse impact can slow down the growth of the market.

 Ventilators Overview
 When people are unable to breathe in case of serious conditions such as asthma, respiratory syndrome, the ventilator is a life-saving device. The growth of the global ventilator industry is projected to be influenced by factors such as growing numbers of intensive care units (ICU) and ICU beds, increasing prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases, urbanisation and rising incidence of emissions, rapid growth in the geriatric population and increasing incidence of preterm births. The rising prevalence of these increases hospital admission rates and readmission of the affected patients as they may require frequent ventilation support. In addition, the development of this market is hindered by factors such as the adverse impact of certain devices on neonates, the management of supply chains of parts and problems associated with the use of mechanical ventilators.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices Overview
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is described as a modified, smaller cardiopulmonary bypass circuit that is used for a short period (days to weeks) in patients with acute cardiac and/or respiratory failure refractory to conventional management. There are two different modes of ECMO, veno-venous (VV) and veno-arterial. The machine pumps blood from the patient's body to an oxygenator, that adds oxygen to it and removes carbon dioxide. Thus, it replaces the function of the person's own lungs.

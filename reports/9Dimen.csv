Global Insulin Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Market Research Report 2021-2025,"An active ingredient (AI) is the ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug that is biologically active. The similar terms active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and bulk active are also used in medicine, and the term active substance may be used for natural products. Some medication products may contain more than one active ingredient. The traditional word for the API is pharmacon or pharmakon which originally denoted a magical substance or drug.

The global API market is segmented based on synthesis, customer base, business type and therapeutic applications. Depending on synthesis the market is classified into synthetic chemical API, biotech API and HPAPI (Highly Potent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient). Biotech API is further segmented into mammalian cell culture, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines, insulin analog, growth hormones and interferons.

In the context of China-US trade war and COVID-19 epidemic, it will have a big influence on this market.

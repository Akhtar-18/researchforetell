"Japan Healthcare Outlook Report, 2021","Jan, 2021",60,60,"Japan’s pharmaceutical market is one of the world’s biggest, with a value of around $95 billion, as per country’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). Japanese firms have a particularly strong standing in their home market, making up six of the country’s top ten pharma companies. Moreover, Takeda, Daiichi Sankyo, and Chugai are now significant global players in pharmaceutical market. 
DelveInsight’s, “Japan Healthcare Outlook Report, 2021,” report provides comprehensive insights about healthcare scenario, regulatory policies and reimbursement landscape in Japan. The report also identifies key trends in the healthcare market and provide insights into the demographic and healthcare infrastructure of the country. Along with this the report also provides a brief look into the trends and segmentation of the pharmaceutical and medical devices market of Japan. 
As per DelveInsight analysis, most major drug makers regard Japan as second to Europe in terms of strategic prioritization. With the Japanese government supportive of the generic drugs, the pharmaceutical outlook of the country is positive. As of 2021, the generics represent 80% of the total market. Over 35% of prescription drugs in Japan are imported from the USA, and this demand is expected to increase as the country has a rapidly aging population, demanding new medicines for associated conditions.
Japan Healthcare Outlook
Japan is an island country of East Asia in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It borders the Sea of Japan to the west and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. It has a population of 126 million, distributed on a territory of 377,915 square kilometers. In 2019, real GDP growth for Japan was 0.7 %. Since the establishment of the universal health insurance scheme in 1961, Japanese citizens have enjoyed a generous system under which the insured members have freedom to access health care facilities and a wide range of medical services for a relatively low co-payments. 
The Japanese administration system comprises three levels: central government; 47 prefectures; and 1,718 municipalities. The national health policy is implemented through local governments. Most basic health and welfare services, such as those for mother and child and the elderly, are provided by municipal government.

Japan Industry Overview Chapter
Pharmaceutical
Japan is considered to be the second largest mature pharmaceutical market in the world in terms of revenue. Japan’s pharmaceutical market value is set to grow in future, driven by new product launches and the healthcare burden of the country’s aging population. However, Japanese government’s promotion of generic drugs, its biennial pricing review system, and the depreciation of the yen against the dollar will be limiting factors. In January 2019, the UK Medical Research Council and the Japanese Agency for Medical Research began collaborating on a project focused on R&D for chronic degenerative and incurable diseases. 
Japan has strong potential in pharmaceutical, with renewed opportunities for international contract service providers, generics and finished drug manufacturers as well as domestic manufacturers to become the local manufacturing arms of international firms. The government of Japan has introduced the Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine and revised the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act (PMD Act) in 2014. This has increased the number of product approvals in regenerative medicine in the country. Besides, the country has taken various initiatives to encourage foreign companies to invest in regenerative medicine. 

Medical Device 
The Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL) covers regulations on pharmaceutical, medical devices and cosmetics. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) is Japan's regulatory authority. It is subordinate to the MHLW. The Japanese government has taken various measures to strengthen its medical device industry by allocating research funds for medical R&D. 
Japan is an economic powerhouse, and its medical device market is one of the biggest in the world. The Japanese medical device industry was valued at $28.1 billion in 2016 and is projected to grow steadily in 2021.
Japan has a robust domestic manufacturing market. Many major Japanese producers are well-known outside Japan. Yet, the majority of the medical devices used in the Japanese healthcare system are imported from other markets. Despite Japan's reputation as a hub of technological innovation, there is still opportunity for foreign manufacturers in the medical device sector. The foreign manufacturer are attracted mostly due to a large segment of population below 65 years of age which needs devices in cardiology, pacemakers, orthopedic implants, home care, preventative care among others.
Foreign manufacturers can also expect hefty competition from domestic manufacturers. Japan is home to leading consumer technology companies that also design medical devices. The greatest competition is in diagnostic imaging, therapeutic and surgical equipment, monitoring systems, home therapeutics, dialyzers, and endoscopes.
Apart from this the report covers some latest information on COVID 19 update and future of healthcare technology in Japan.

Japan: Market Access

Market access section of the Japan Healthcare Outlook report contains information on how to penetrate the pharmaceutical and medical device markets in terms of setting up manufacturing unit, import export licensing, regulations pertaining to patents, trademarks, clinical trials, advertising, pharmacy regulation, labelling and packaging. It also covers detail about healthcare insurance and reimbursement policy. 
The Japanese regulatory process can be lengthy and expensive. Regulations and documents are published almost exclusively in Japanese and the PMD Act imposes strict requirement and clinical standards for foreign manufacturers. An experienced regulatory partner with a presence in Japan is essential. As such, large corporations with the resources to push through the regulatory process already have a strong hold on the Japanese market.
The Price Maintenance Premium (PMP) system, which was implemented in 2010 with the goal of creating a stable and reliable pricing situation for innovators, was changed drastically by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. As a result, opportunities to command a higher price based on higher levels of innovation are also shrinking, with a more narrow definition used to determine which products can command a premium. In 2018, only 560 products met these criteria, compared with 823 in just two years previously.

About 18% of a citizen’s income tax goes towards healthcare, which is about 4.5% of the average citizen’s income. Overall, around 8.4% of the UK's gross domestic product is spent on healthcare. UK also has a growing private healthcare sector that is still much smaller than the public sector.
The UK has a government-sponsored public healthcare system called the NHS. The NHS is composed of a group of UK publicly funded healthcare systems. It encompasses the National Health System (England), NHS Scotland, NHS Wales and Northern Ireland Health and Social Care. Under this scheme, people are entitled to healthcare but still have the option of purchasing private health insurance. The NHS Plan promises more patient capacity and information, more hospitals and beds, more nurses and doctors, considerably shorter waiting times for services and better treatment for elderly patients and tighter NHS guidelines.
Social care services are a shared responsibility between the local NHS and the local government’s Directors of Social Services, and falls under the guidance of the Department of Health. According to the World Health Organization, government funding covers 85% of healthcare expenditure in the UK. The remaining 15% is covered by private sector.
UK Industry Overview Chapter
Pharmaceutical
The UK is home to GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, respectively the world's fifth- and sixth-largest pharmaceutical companies. Foreign companies with a major presence in the UK pharmaceutical industry include Pfizer, Novartis, Hoffmann–La Roche and Eisai. One in five of the world's biggest-selling prescription drugs were developed in the UK. The most notable event for the pharma industry so far has been the update of the government’s life sciences strategy, which lays out plans for the sector’s future. This June 2016, it's been four years since UK citizens accepted a UK referendum to leave the EU (i.e., Brexit). Whether or not the United Kingdom would have an agreement in shaping its future relationship with the EU is still on the negotiation table as the deadline for achieving an agreement looms. After a multi-year process to exit the EU, the UK officially exited the EU on January 31, 2021 and entered into an 11-month transition period until the end of 2021 to work out or not its future relationship with the EU. During the transition period, EU law and rules are still applicable across the UK, and the UK remains part of the EU single market and custom union. The UK will formally exit the EU in all ways by the end of the transition period on December 31, 2021.
Medical Device 
An important development for life science businesses is the publication of the Medicines and Medical Devices Bill. As expected, this draft legislation will provide for the UK Government to take over the rulebook for human and veterinary medicines, clinical trials and medical devices after the end of the transition period on 31st December 2021. Currently very closely harmonized at EU level, the legislation is not expected to diverge rapidly from EU law. However, there are clear signals in the Bill and Explanatory Notes that a separate approach is likely to evolve.
Legislation in this area has previously been updated at EU level, with the changes flowing through into UK law. The Medicines and Medical Devices Bill will allow the Health Secretary to take over that task. The Bill proposes similar powers to amend or supplement the medical devices legislation. Of course, the existing EU directives in this area are due to be replaced by two new Regulations:
• Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices (applicable from 26 May 2021)
• Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (applicable from 26 May 2022).
Apart from this the report covers some latest information on COVID 19 update and future of healthcare technology in UK.

Over the past year, investment into the UK healthcare real estate market has grown ever more international. The biggest deal of 2019 saw Medical Properties Trust (MPT) acquire 30 private hospitals for billions of Euro, making it the largest real estate deal of the year. The deal was part of Circle Health’s acquisition of BMI Healthcare, which comprised 54 hospitals in total. There is driven demand from a broader range of investors in recent years, from opportunistic private equity funds to risk-averse pension providers. UK performed well when it came to quality of care and access to care. The UK also ranked first in efficiency, which was measured by examining total national spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP, as well as the amount spent on healthcare administration and insurance. Quality of care one of the key focuses of the NHS. Indeed, one of their stated goals is to enhance the quality and safety standards of health and social care services.

"Germany Healthcare Outlook Report, 2021","Jan, 2021",60,60,"DelveInsight’s, “Germany Healthcare Outlook Report, 2021,” report provides comprehensive insights about healthcare scenario, regulatory policies and reimbursement landscape in Germany. The report also identifies key trends in the healthcare market and provides insights into the demographic and healthcare infrastructure of the country. Along with this the report also provides a brief look into the trends and segmentation of the pharmaceutical and medical devices market of Germany. 
As per DelveInsight’s analysis, some of the best-known medical device manufacturers are based in Germany, and some major players from around the world have operations in Germany. However, small- to mid-sized medical device companies make up the majority of the industry. Germany is an attractive market due to its consistent growth and sophisticated approach to healthcare. Demand for highly innovative technologies and diagnostic, therapeutic, and minimally invasive equipment remains high. Many German manufacturers export their products, leaving an opportunity for foreign importers to capitalize on these demands.

Germany Healthcare Outlook
Germany officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a country in Central and Western Europe with 83.2 million people, distributed on a territory of 357,022 square kilometers. In 2019, GDP growth for Germany was 0.6 %. Germany has a universal multi-payer health care system. It encompasses both statutory health insurance for people who earn less than a certain salary, as well as private health insurance for those who earn more and choose to purchase their own. Health insurance is provided by two subsystems: statutory health insurance (SHI), consisting of competing, not-for-profit, nongovernmental health insurance plans known as sickness funds; and private health insurance. Long-term care services are covered separately under Germany’s mandatory, statutory long-term care insurance (LTCI). Unlike those in many other countries, sickness funds and private health insurers, as well as long-term care insurers, use the same providers. In other words, hospitals and physicians treat all patients regardless of whether they have SHI or private insurance.
Employers and their employees pay for most of the health care system in Germany through premiums. All workers contribute about 7.5 percent of their salary into a public health insurance pool. Employers match that 7.5 percent contribution. The ideology lives on in the modern German system. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care. And the system imposes strict limits on out-of-pocket costs, greatly reducing the number of surprise medical bills.

The first new bill introduced in 2018 (the SHI-Contribution Relief Law, or GKV-Versichertenentlastungsgesetz) aims to reduce the mandatory contributions that individuals in SHI pay every month. While the general contribution of 14.6% has been equally shared between employers and employees since 2015, the supplementary contribution is paid by employees only. The law plans to reinstate the equal split of general and supplementary contributions between employers and employees.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Health has recently issued a decree on minimum staffing requirements for nurses in hospitals. The maximum number of patients per nurse has been defined for hospital units where nursing staff is particularly needed — intensive care, geriatric, cardiology, and trauma surgery — to guarantee patient safety. The regulation went into effect January 2019.
Germany Industry Overview Chapter
Pharmaceutical
The German pharmaceutical market is the largest in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. 1170 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with more than 128,000 workers (2015) operate in Germany. In addition to globally successful enterprises, the industry composed of more than 800 medium-sized businesses and young biotech companies. German companies invest $6.5 billion (2016) annually in research and development. Within Europe, Germany is the leading market for non-prescription medicines products.
Medical Device 
The German medical device market is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world. It was valued at $26 billion in 2014 and continues to grow despite a sluggish European economy. Germany has become one of the world’s most important countries for clinical studies. Germany is the leader in industry-initiated clinical studies in Europe and second worldwide. The dense network of universities and faculties as well as a variety of research institutions not affiliated to universities speak in favor of Germany as a business location.

It also covers detail about healthcare insurance and reimbursement policy. 
The German health care system is notable for the sharing of decision-making powers among the federal and state governments and self-regulated organizations of payers and providers. Within Germany’s legal framework, the federal government has wide-ranging regulatory power over health care but is not directly involved in care delivery. The Federal Joint Committee, which is supervised by the Federal Ministry of Health, determines the services to be covered by sickness funds. To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from comparative-effectiveness reviews and health technology (benefit-risk) assessments.

"Italy Healthcare Outlook Report, 2021","Jan, 2021",60,60,"DelveInsight’s, “Italy Healthcare Outlook Report, 2021,” report provides comprehensive insights about healthcare scenario, regulatory policies and reimbursement landscape in Italy. The report also identifies key trends in the healthcare market and provides insights into the demographic and healthcare infrastructure of the country. Along with this the report also provides a brief look into the trends and segmentation of the pharmaceutical and medical devices market of Italy. 
As per DelveInsight analysis, National Committees have reduced income inequality, giving stipends to the poor, shrinking the gap between high and low incomes, raising pensions and minimum wages as they’re high enough to live on, and fixed tax structure eventually leads to good healthcare system. The Government health care make sure everyone has access to affordable healthcare, gives working staffs the same freedom to have kids (maternity leave), convalesce (sick leave), and relax (proper vacations). R&D pharma investments in Italy are growing rapidly. Italy and the UK, provide universal access to treatment and medications, with minimal point-of-service payments and with prices kept down by government negotiation represents good governance.

Italy Healthcare Outlook
Italy officially the Italian Republic, with 60.36 million people, distributed on a territory of 301,338 square kilometers. Italy is the 4th country in the world healthcare ranking. Italy's healthcare system is routinely ranked among the best in the world, based on its overall quality, equity of access, and the general health and life expectancy of the Italian population. In 2019, GDP growth for Italy was 0.30%. The healthcare system in Italy is a regionally based national health service known as Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN). It provides universal coverage to citizens and residents, with public healthcare largely free of charge. Public Health Service in Italy covers both citizens and legal nationals of foreign countries. It is financed by corporate and value-added tax revenues rose by the central government and allocated to the caregiving state governments. 
Private health insurance plays a small part in the health care system in Italy. The central government is responsible for national health goals and objectives. Also the central government decides annual SSN funding and monitors resource allocation for each region. Patients make prescription costs for hospital appointments and operations as well as for certain ambulatory medications. Expectant women, HIV patients or other medical conditions, and young children and older adults in lower-income households are excluded from cost sharing. Even if an individual venture outside the National Health Service to private doctors and hospitals, Italian healthcare is far less expensive. In terms of healthcare, child mortality, obesity, cancer, diabetes, suicide, drug addiction, suicides, and disability rates, the Italians are much healthier than the Americans. As Italy is being adversely affected by COVID-19, on March 16th 2021, the Italian Government presented a 25-billion-euro package as an immediate response to the COVID-19 outbreak in order to strengthen the Italian health care system and support companies, workers, and families. The aim is to protect citizens’ health, support businesses, and preserve employment levels and incomes.

Vietnam Industry Overview Chapter
Pharmaceutical
Vietnam is among the fastest growing markets in South East Asia and it is expected that country is going to keep the pace for the coming decades due to government focusing on the sector. National Strategy for Development of the Vietnamese Pharmaceutical Industry to 2021” is one such plan that supports investments in drug production, drug materials, essential drugs, social diseases drugs, and vaccines. Along with this, the government provides new incentives to R&D in production technology and biotechnology to manufacture new drugs. Though the domestic market is currently dominated by foreign products because of the under-development of domestic firm but Vietnam has a potential market for pharmaceutical products, which is expected to expand rapidly in the near future. Some of the major international pharmaceutical companies working in Vietnam are Abbott, Bayer AG and Sanofi among others. Whereas, DHG Pharma, Traphaco and Vietnam Pharmaceutical Corporation are some of the domestic players. 

Medical Device 
Currently, 90% of medical devices in Vietnam are imported, mainly from Japan, Germany, the United States, China and Singapore. The local production of medical equipment is poor and does not meet the demand. Local producers have only been able to supply basic medical supplies such as hospital beds and disposables. Therefore, Vietnamese government encourages the import of medical devices and offers low import duties and restrictions. According to Ministry of Health the country’s medical equipment market is expected to enjoy a growth rate of 18-20% in 2016-2021, however, domestic enterprises currently comprising of 50 medical equipment manufacturers, which are licensed by the MOH, account for only 10% of the local market share.

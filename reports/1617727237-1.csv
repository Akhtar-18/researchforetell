P selectin inhibitors Understanding
P selectin inhibitors: Overview
P-Selectin (CD62P), previously termed PADGEM or GMP-140, is a single chain glycoprotein of 140 kDa expressed in platelets and endothelial cells. In platelets, P-selectin is stored in α granules, whereas in endothelial cells it is found in Weibel–Palade bodies. P-selectin mediates the rolling of blood cells on the surface of the endothelium and initiates the attachment of leukocytes circulating in the blood to platelets, endothelial cells, and other leukocytes at sites of tissue injury and inflammation. P-selectin plays a key role in diseases associated with injury and arterial thrombosis. Increased expression of P-selectin is observed in coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery diseases. Increased level of sP-selectin and elevated P-selectin expression may be good markers of some types of carcinoma, such as neoplastic pulmonary diseases, breast, renal, and colon cancer, and blood cancer. P-selectin inhibition with protein therapeutics such as antibodies or soluble ligands given intravenously can decrease thrombosis in a mouse ligation model of venous thrombosis. Inhibition of P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) play a key role in proliferation of Multiple myeloma.

Interleukin-33 inhibitors Understanding
Interleukin-33 inhibitors: Overview
IL-33 belongs to the IL-1 family of cytokines. IL-33 is a novel cytokine that signals through the ST2 surface receptor. IL-33 receptor has a single chain, which is also related to the IL-1 receptor (interleukin-1 receptor-like 1, IL-1RL1). Signal transduction upon ligand binding involves the Toll-like receptor (TIR) domain of the receptor chain and resembles that of IL-1 and IL-18, and TLRs. IL-33 exhibits diverse immune regulatory functions during the various phases of different diseases. IL-33 likely functions as a disease sensitizer and plays pathological roles in inflamed tissues in allergic disorders that involve hyperreactive immune responses. In contrast, IL-33 also mediates tissue-protective functions during the recovery phase following tissue injury, which involves activation of tissue-reparative M2 macrophages, ILC2s, and Tregs.  IL-33 could be used against inflammation caused by Th1 response, and antagonists perhaps might be developed as anti-allergic compounds. Targeting the IL-33-ST2 axis using monoclonal antibodies (or small-molecule inhibitors) could prove to be an effective strategy against COVID-19 virus. The combination of IL-33 blockade with other therapeutics could be an option for the efficacious treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Understanding
Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapeutics: Overview
Antisense oligonucleotide (ASOs) are small-sized single-stranded nucleic acids that offer advantages over siRNAs in terms of targeting both nuclear and cytoplasmic located lncRNAs. Antisense oligonucleotide-based therapeutics involves downregulation of gene expression. Antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are a class of synthetic nucleic acid molecules that are capable of regulating gene expression through binding to premature or mature messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), known as genetic materials, are promising agents used in the regulation of unsuitable expression of genes in pathological situations by the specific inhibition of expression of their mRNA targets. By capitalizing “antisense” DNA approach, the overexpressed proteins can be blocked in several diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation and autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, etc. ASOs are emerging as a class of therapeutics with high potential to treat diseases affecting the CNS.

Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists Understanding
Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists: Overview
The human Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor (GLP-1) receptor is located on chromosome 6 (6p21). The GLP-1 receptor sequence contains a large hydrophilic extracellular domain and seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Glucagon-like peptide-1 amide (GLP-1) is a 30-residue peptide hormone released from intestinal L cells following nutrient consumption. It potentiates the glucose-induced secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells, increases insulin expression, inhibits beta-cell apoptosis, promotes beta-cell neogenesis, reduces glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, promotes satiety and increases peripheral glucose disposal. These multiple physiological effects make it an attractive candidate for type 2 diabetes therapy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are a class of medications utilized in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches for Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists.

Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists Emerging Drugs
• IBI-362: Innovent Biologics
IBI362 is a long-acting synthetic peptide related to mammalian oxyntomodulin (OXM). Similar to OXM, IBI362 binds to and activates both the glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR). IBI362 uses a fatty acid side chain to prolong the duration of action and allow once-weekly administration. Innovent entered into a licensing agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) for the development and potential commercialization of OXM3 in China (IBI362), and Lilly is developing it outside China. IBI-362 has the potential to be developed as an important therapy for diabetes, obesity and potentially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and may provide a more effective treatment regimen for overweight and obese patients.

•      Tirzepatide: Eli Lilly and Company
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly acylated, long-acting dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and a glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. It integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase III development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors Understanding
Glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors: Overview
Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) is a glucosyltranserase that processes the sphingolipid ceramide. The product, glucosylceramide, can be further elaborated with a variety of oligosaccharides to become glycosphingolipids called gangliosides (most notably GM1 and GM3). Excess glycosphingolipids have been correlated with a variety of human diseases. The pathologies associated with lysosomal storage disorders (Gaucher, Fabry, Tay-Sachs, and Sandhoff) stem from improper disposal of glucosylceramide and other glycosphingolipids. Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase and the consequent lysosomal accumulation of unmetabolized glycolipid substrates. Substrate reduction therapy through inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) has also been shown to effectively treat the visceral disease.

GABA A receptor agonist Understanding
GABA A receptor agonist: Overview
Type-A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) are the principal mediators of rapid inhibitory synaptic transmission in the human brain. A decline in GABAAR signalling triggers hyperactive neurological disorders such as insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. GABAARs are the targets of a wide range of drugs including benzodiazepines, used in the treatment of epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety and panic disorder, and the intravenous general anaesthetics propofol and etomidate. GABAARs also mediate alcohol inebriation and are targets for endogenous modulators such as neurosteroids.

Report Highlights

GABA A receptor agonist Emerging Drugs
• Ganaxolone: Marinus Pharmaceuticals
Ganaxolone is a GABAA receptor modulator that acts by regulating brain activity. This process can include inhibiting the abnormal electrical discharges that cause seizures and status epilepticus or restoring balance in disrupted neuronal activity in other neurologic and psychiatric disorders. GABA is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Ganaxolone binds to one of the receptor subtypes, the GABAA receptor. When this receptor is activated, it increases the movement of chloride ions through a pore on the cell surface. This action changes the positive and negative charges inside and outside the cell, which inhibits the firing of the neuron. Ganaxolone is an analogue of the naturally occurring neurosteroid, allopregnanolone. Neurosteroids do not possess the metabolic effects of other steroids; rather, they regulate the balance of excitatory and inhibitory brain activity.  Ganaxolone has been designed with an added methyl group that prevents back-conversion to an active steroid intended to better maintain its specific neuromodulatory activity. 
•   Padsevonil: UCB Biopharma
Padsevonil is a dual-acting antiepileptic drug that has a mechanism of action designed specifically to interact with pre- and post-synaptic targets. Presynaptically, it binds with high affinity to the three isoforms of synaptic vesicle protein 2: SV2A, SV2B and SV2C. Postsynaptically, it binds with moderate affinity to the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABAA receptor, where it acts as a partial agonist. Previous results of a Phase II proof-of-concept study demonstrated that treatment with padsevonil may be associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in focal seizure frequency and suggested an acceptable tolerability/safety profile. It is currently in Phase II/III stage of development (NCT03370120).

Plasminogen activators Understanding
Plasminogen activators: Overview
Plasmin is the serine protease responsible for degradation of fibrin. Two forms of the zymogen precursor plasminogen circulate in plasma, the native more abundant form, Glu-plasminogen, and the intermediate form Lys-plasminogen, formed by cleavage of the N-terminal peptide from Glu-plasminogen. The plasminogen activator (PA) system is an extracellular proteolytic enzyme system associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes. The first-generation plasminogen activators like streptokinase and urokinase are compounds found in nature that lack fibrin selectivity, while second-generation activators including t-PA and scu-PA are natural human proteins that possess some fibrin selectivity and can be produced either by selected human cell cultures or by recombinant DNA methods. The third-generation plasminogen activators are numerous compounds that are in clinical development and possess enhanced properties as a result either of chemical modification or of the application of recombinant DNA technology.

Serotonin receptor 2 Agonist Understanding
Serotonin receptor 2 Agonist: Overview
Serotonin receptors are Endogenous compounds and drugs that bind to and activate serotonin receptors. Many serotonin receptor agonists are used as antidepressants; anxiolytics; and in the treatment of migraine disorders. 

Function – Serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) are widely distributed in the central nervous system, especially in brain region essential for learning and cognition. The serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is a GPCR of the type A family. Within the brain this receptor participates in processes such as cognition and working memory, been implicated in effective disorders such as schizophrenia, and mediate the primary effects of hallucinogenic drugs. In the periphery,  receptors have been linked to vasoconstriction and hypertension, and to inflammatory processes that can lead to atherosclerosis.

Serotonin receptor 2 Agonist- Agonists acting at 5-HT2A receptors located on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells within regions of the prefrontal cortex are believed to mediate hallucinogenic activity.

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor antagonists Understanding
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor antagonists: Overview
Platelet-derived growth factor receptors belong to class III receptor tyrosine kinases. In human, there are four genes expressing PDGF chains: PDGF-A, B, C and D. PDGFA, PDGFB, PDGFC, and PDGFD genes are located on chromosomes 7, 22, 4, and 11, respectively. Platelet-derived growth factor plays a significant role in cell proliferation and embryonic development and is regulated through the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is a compelling target for developing therapeutic agents to treat diseases associated with overactivated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling and has proved to be particularly encouraging for cancer treatment.

TIL Therapy Understanding
TIL Therapy: Overview
TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte) therapy is a type of cellular immunotherapy that may be used to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, lung cancer, genitourinary cancers and a growing list of other malignancies. TIL therapy essentially uses altered tumor cells to destroy the tumor itself. TILs, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, are special immune system cells (T cells) that are naturally present inside some tumors. In TIL therapy, TILs are collected from the tumor during a biopsy, or surgical resection, and grown to very large numbers in a laboratory with interleukin-2 (IL-2), a protein that promotes rapid TIL growth. Once successfully grown to billions in number, the TILs are infused back into the patient, where they actively attack cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone.

Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists Understanding
Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists: Overview
DRD2 encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. Alternative splicing of this G protein-coupled receptor results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms. DRD2 plays a major role in the neural circuitry that mediates behavioral control, an ability that is essential for adaptive responding and is compromised in a variety of common neuropsychiatric disorders.

Function – Dopamine receptors are G protein–coupled receptors involved in the regulation of motor activity and several neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Dopamine is a monoamine catecholamine neurotransmitter belonging to the 7 transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which play an important role in the regulation of not only motor functions but also non-motor functions such as motivation, cognition, emotion, and neuroendocrine secretion.

Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists- Dopamine (DA) D2 receptor antagonists have been linked to elevated levels of nicotine dependence in smokers with schizophrenia. Because activation of D2 receptors mediates motivation for nicotine, potent D2 antagonists would diminish nicotine's ability to stimulate reward processing-a mechanism that may drive compensatory increases in smoking.

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein inhibitors Understanding
Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein inhibitors: Overview
Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 that mediates chromatin-based gene silencing through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3. This complex plays vital roles in the regulation of development-specific gene expression.

Function – Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase enzyme encoded by EZH2 gene, that participates in histone methylation and, ultimately, transcriptional repression. EZH2 catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to histone H3 at lysine 27, by using the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Mutation or over-expression of EZH2 has been linked to many forms of cancer. EZH2 inhibits genes responsible for suppressing tumor development, and blocking EZH2 activity may slow tumor growth. EZH2 has been targeted for inhibition because it is up regulated in multiple cancers.

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein inhibitors – EZH2 is upregulated in various cancers with high levels associated with metastatic cancer and poor prognosis.  Dysregulation of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 plays a critical role in the development of a variety of malignancies including B-cell lymphomas.

Potassium channel antagonists Understanding
Potassium channel antagonists: Overview
Potassium channel blockers are agents which interfere with conduction through potassium channels. Potassium is the chief ion in the repolarization. At the end of depolarization, potassium efflux occurs following the opening of the potassium channels. This group of drugs binds to the channel which is responsible for the potassium movement and blocks it. Once the blocking has happened, the refractory period increases.

Function – Potassium-channel blockers comprise the Class III antiarrhythmic compounds according to the Vaughan-Williams classification scheme. These drugs bind to and block the potassium channels that are responsible for phase 3 repolarization. Therefore, blocking these channels slows (delays) repolarization, which leads to an increase in action potential duration and an increase in the effective refractory period (ERP).

Potassium channel antagonists – Potassium Channel antagonist act by inhibition of potassium efflux through cell membranes. Blockade of potassium channels prolongs the duration of Action potentials. They are used as Anti-Arrhythmia agents and Vasodilator agents.

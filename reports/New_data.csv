Global Spandex Market Overview
Spandex is a highly popular and most commonly used material type in the manufacturing of activewear and sportswear. Owing to its high stretchability, it makes the clothes agile and comfortable for movements. The spandex fiber material is known to stretch 100 times more than its original size, making it a favorite material for sportswear. It is also breathable, wicks moisture, and dries quickly. This is the main reason it is a staple in form-fitting exercise clothes. With the rising wellness trend among consumers, the activewear segment is expanding. This factor, in turn, is expected to boost the demand for spandex fiber in manufacturing sportswear and activewear garments keeping users pleasantly cool and dry with natural comfort and versatility.

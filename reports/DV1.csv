Chronic Pulmonary Infections Understanding
Chronic Pulmonary Infections: Overview
Lung infections are very common and are caused by viruses, bacteria and fungal organisms. Chronic lung (or pulmonary) infections affect the lower respiratory tract and can be very debilitating.  The most common causes are from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis, all of which involve inability to clear secretions. The most common symptom of a chronic pulmonary infection is a persistent, severe cough. Sputum culture is performed to identity the infectious agent, and sensitivity testing of this organism can demonstrate any antibiotic resistances that have developed from previous antibiotic exposures. Pulmonary function testing is performed to evaluate the degree of lung compromise with functional testing such as spirometry.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis Understanding
Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Overview
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), is a buildup of acids in the blood. It can happen when the blood sugar levels remain high for a long time. It occurs when absolute or relative insulin deficiency inhibits the ability of glucose to enter cells for utilization as metabolic fuel, and as a result the liver rapidly breaks down fat into ketones to employ as a source of fuel. The overproduction of ketones causes them to accumulate in the blood and urine and turn the blood acidic. The treatment for DKA usually involves a combination of approaches to normalize blood sugar and insulin levels. The therapies involved in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis are: fluid replacement therapy, insulin therapy, and electrolyte replacement.

Crohn’s Disease Understanding
Crohn’s Disease: Overview
Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, where inflammation extends all the way through the intestinal wall from mucosa to serosa. It is a relapsing and remitting disease. Initially only a small segment of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved, but Crohn’s disease has the potential to progress extensively. The inflammation observed in the digestive tract is followed by abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Crohn’s disease in people can be both painful and weakening, sometimes leading to life-threatening complications. The inflammation caused in the intestine can be skipped in between the patches of diseased intestine. The signs and symptoms observed in patients suffering from Crohn’s disease tends to vary and can change over a period of time.

Excessive Daytime Sleepiness: Overview
Excessive daytime sleepiness is not a condition in itself but a symptom of different conditions. Any condition that restrains an individual from getting good sleep at night can cause excessive daytime sleepiness. The common causes for excessive daytime sleepiness include sleep apnea (a potentially serious condition with abnormal breathing pattern during night), RLS (restless leg syndrome), depression, hypersomnia, and narcolepsy. Hypersomnia and narcolepsy have some similar characteristics. Both the condition involves excessive daytime sleepiness but narcolepsy is rare and more severe with sudden and uncontrollable sleeps, often at inconvenient times. People with narcolepsy also have greater nighttime sleep disturbance than those with hypersomnia, resulting in reduced sleep quality.

End-Stage Renal Disease Understanding
End-Stage Renal Disease: Overview
End-stage renal disease, also called end-stage kidney disease, occurs when chronic kidney disease — the gradual loss of kidney function — reaches an advanced state. In end-stage renal disease, the kidneys are no longer able to work as they should to meet the body's needs. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the last stage (stage five) of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This means kidneys are only functioning at 10 to 15 percent of their normal capacity.  When chronic kidney disease develops into ESRD, dialysis or a kidney transplant is necessary to stay alive. ESRD is caused most commonly due to diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure). The treatments for ESRD are dialysis or a kidney transplant. In some cases, lifestyle changes and medications may help.

ER+/ HER2 -ve Breast Cancer Understanding
ER+/ HER2 -ve Breast Cancer: Overview
Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer. Most breast cancers express the estrogen receptor (ER) receptor and are negative for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor. The backbone of their systemic therapy consists of hormonal therapies that block the function of ER through various mechanisms. These include blockade of the receptor itself in breast cancer cells, blockade of the production of its major ligand, estradiol, or degradation of the receptor. However, a subset of ER+/HER2? breast cancers, mostly corresponding to the genomic luminal B genotype, are resistant to hormonal manipulations from the outset of therapies. 
""ER+/ HER2 -ve Breast Cancer- Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the ER+/ HER2 -ve Breast Cancer pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and ER+/ HER2 -ve Breast Cancer treatment guidelines.

ER+/ HER2 -ve Breast Cancer Emerging Drugs
• H3B-6545: Eisai
An orally administered selective estrogen receptor alpha (ER?) covalent antagonist that inhibits ER? wild type / ER? mutant. Expected to show an antitumor effect against ER positive / HER2 negative breast cancers. 
• Rintodestrant (G1T48): G1 Therapeutics
Rintodestrant is a potential best-in-class oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) in development for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. Preclinical data have shown rintodestrant to be more potent than fulvestrant, currently the only FDA-approved SERD. The company initiated a phase 1/2a trial of rintodestrant in ER+/HER2 -ve breast cancer.
• GDC-9545: Genetech/ La Roche
GDC-9545 is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that is designed to bind to the estrogen to limit its function. In addition, when SERDs bind to the estrogen receptor, they may be able to change the shape of the receptor in such a way that the cell eliminates it by degradation.

Gallbladder cancer: Overview
Gallbladder cancer is a small, pear shaped organ located beneath the liver. The bladder stores bile enzymes produced by the liver and helps in digestion. Gallbladder cancer is a rare type of cancer that is characterized by the abnormal growth of cells in the Gallbladder cancer area. Most of the Gallbladder cancer begins in glandular cells which form the lining of the inner surface of the organ. This type of cancer is very rare and is caused due to the DNA mutations in the Gallbladder cancer cells. Gallbladder cancer is more common in middle aged women with a history of gallstones. However, it can also occur in men. Gallbladder cancer can be of various types such as papillary adenocarcinomas, adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and others.

Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ESCLC) Understanding
Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ESCLC): Overview
Extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ESCLC) is in the stage where it has spread to other parts of the body, such as the other lung or the brain. Without treatment, the average life expectancy for a person with an extensive-stage small cell lung cancer diagnosis is two to four months. The liver, adrenal glands, and bone are also common sites of metastasis. Though extensive-stage small cell lung cancer cannot be cured and has a poor prognosis, it may respond to chemotherapy and newer treatments. Because the cancer has spread, the main treatment for extensive stage SCLC is chemotherapy. Common chemo drugs used for ESCLC are: carboplatin and cisplatin. Other therapies used to treat ESCLS include: immunotherapy and radiation therapy.

Heart failure Understanding
Heart failure: Overview
Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure refers to the condition when heart is not able to pump adequate blood to the body. In the absence of sufficient blood flow, all the major body functions are disrupted. Certain conditions, such as narrowed arteries in the heart (coronary artery disease) or high blood pressure, gradually leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump efficiently. Heart failure can be diagnosed based on the medical and family history, a physical exam, and test results. Treating heart failure depends on the severity of the condition. Diagnostic tests include: electrocardiogram, chest X-Ray, echocardiography etc. Treatments usually include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and ongoing care.

Graves Ophthalmopathy Understanding
Graves’ Ophthalmopathy: Overview
Graves’ ophthalmopathy, also called Graves’ orbitopathy or Thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO), is part of an autoimmune process that can affect the orbital and periorbital tissue, the thyroid gland, and, rarely, the pretibial skin or digits. Generally, occur in patients with hyperthyroidism or a history of hyperthyroidism. Risk factors for thyroid-associated orbitopathy include increased age of onset, duration of Graves’ hyperthyroidism, and smoking. The ocular manifestations of thyroid-associated orbitopathy include eyelid retraction, proptosis, chemosis, periorbital edema, and altered ocular motility with significant functional, social, and cosmetic consequences.

Molluscum Contagiosum Understanding
Molluscum Contagiosum: Overview
Molluscum Contagiosum is a common viral infection of skin that is characterized by pinkish, firm, round, and painless bumps over the skin. The size of the bump can vary from a few mm to 2-5 mm in diameter. The disease is caused by poxvirus Molluscum contagiosum. The lesion becomes red, swollen, and itchy at times and can spread to other areas of the body when scratched (autoinoculation). The disease can spread from person to person through physical contact or contaminated fomites. Though the molluscum contagiosum is common, the persons with weakened immune system, atopic dermatitis, or inhabiting in warm, moist, and crowded places are more prone to the infection. The infection is not age –specific but is most common in children with 1-10 years of age.

Netherton Syndrome Understanding
Netherton Syndrome: Overview
Netherton Syndrome is a rare disorder that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The disorder is caused due to the mutation in the SPINK5 gene located on chromosome 5 which is responsible for encoding proteins that serve as the break on the activity of certain proteases in the skin protein. This disorder mainly affects the immune system, skin, and hair of an individual and is characterized by elevated IgE levels, scaling skin, hair anomalies, and increased susceptibility to atopic eczema. The syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 200,000 newborn.

Necrobiosis Lipoidica Understanding
Necrobiosis Lipoidica: Overview
Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare granulomatous skin disorder that usually appears in the shin area of the body and is often related to diabetes mellitus. It is an idiopathic dermatological condition. In the beginning, the lesions appear as erythematous circle papules that then evolve to well-demarcated, atrophic, shiny, yellow-brown telangiectasic multiple and bilateral plaques. The plaques develop slowly and rarely the condition ulcerates and become painful. The disease is more prevalent in females as compared to males. The exact cause of necrobiosis lipoidica is still unclear.

Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) Understanding
Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC): Overview
Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers. There are three kinds of NSCLC tumors: a) Adenocarcinoma starts in cells inside air sacs that make mucus and other substances, often in the outer parts of your lungs. It's the most common kind of lung cancer among both smokers and nonsmokers and people under 45. It often grows more slowly than other lung cancers. b) Squamous cell lung carcinoma starts in cells that line the inner airways of the lungs. About a quarter of lung cancers are this kind. c) Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma grows and spreads more quickly. That can make it tougher to treat. It's about 10% of lung cancers. An effective treatment for non-small cell adenocarcinoma depends on the cancer’s stage. Surgery to remove all or only part of the lung is usually required if the cancer hasn’t spread.

Because the G12C KRAS mutation is relatively common in some cancer types, 14% of non-small-cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma patients and 5% of colorectal cancer patients, and AMG 510 is the first drug candidate to target this mutation, there have been high expectations for the drug. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a fast track designation to AMG 510 for the treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma with the G12C KRAS mutation. The drug is in preregistration stage for the treatment of NSCLC.
? CMP 001: Cytos Biotechnology
CMP 001 is a short piece of DNA, called an oligonucleotide that Checkmate designed to mimic the DNA of bacteria. It encapsulated the DNA in noninfectious virus-like particles, or VLPs. The company created CMP-001 to be administered directly to a tumor. When this occurs, the immune system sees VLPs as foreign. It generates immune cells called antigen presenting cells that release the DNA from the VLPs. CMP 001 is in phase 1 of clinical trials for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection Understanding
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: Overview
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is caused by bacterium Pseudomonas, a gram-negative bacterium commonly found in the environment e.g., in soil, water, and other moist places. Pseudomonas are opportunistic bacteria which infect individuals who have weak immune system. These bacteria are predominantly responsible for nosocomial infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes urinary tract infections, respiratory system infections, dermatitis, soft tissue infections, bacteremia, bone and joint infections, gastrointestinal infections and a variety of systemic infections, particularly in patients with severe burns and in cancer and AIDS patients who are immunosuppressed. Diagnosing Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection requires laboratory assessments of body fluids such as blood, pus, and urine. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection can be treated by administration of commonly used antibiotics for instance, gentamicin, tobramycin, and others. However, emergence of multi-drug resistance bacterial strain has made the treatment difficult.

Small Fiber Neuropathy Understanding
Small Fiber Neuropathy: Overview
Small fiber neuropathy occurs as a result of damage to the small fibers of the peripheral nervous system are damaged. Small fibers in the skin carries sensory information about pain and temperature. In the organs, these small fibers regulate automatic functions such as heart rate and breathing. Small fiber neuropathy may sometimes be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as diabetes or an autoimmune disease. Most small fiber neuropathies occur in a length-dependent fashion, resulting in loss of function in a stocking distribution in the lower extremities. When the condition is more advanced, a glove-like loss in the upper extremities also may occur. In rare cases, a non–length dependent neuropathy results in symptoms involving the trunk, face, proximal limbs, or other focal areas. Pain in the feet and hands is the most common early symptom of small fiber neuropathy.

• Filgotinib: Gilead Sciences
Filgotinib is an orally available inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), with potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating activities. Filgotinib specifically targets, and inhibits the phosphorylation of JAK1, which interferes with JAK/STAT-dependent signaling. JAK1 plays a key role in the signaling and activity of many cytokines and growth factors and is often dysregulated in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as some malignancies. 
Filgotinib was discovered and developed by Galapagos using its target and drug discovery technology platform. Filgotinib is approved and marketed as Jyseleca (200 mg and 100 mg tablets) in Europe and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA. It is currently in Preregistration Phase.
• Upadacitinib: Abbvie
Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is an oral, once daily, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. It possess greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 versus JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK1 inhibition blocks the signaling of many important pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-15, which are known to contribute for inflammatory disorders. 
In 2019, RINVOQ (Upadacitinib) received USFDA and European Commission approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Upadacitinib is currently under Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.

Vitiligo Understanding
Vitiligo: Overview
Vitiligo is a complex pigment disorder that involves the skin, the hair, and occasionally the mucous membranes. It is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. Vitiligo can affect any area of skin, but it commonly happens on the face, neck and hands. Vitiligo appears clinically as milk-white irregularly oval patches of skin, which are small at the beginning but enlarge gradually. The hair growing in the depigmented area is also white. Vitiligo can be triggered by stress to the melanin pigment-producing cells of the skin, the melanocytes. The triggers, which range from sunburn to mechanical trauma and chemical exposures, ultimately cause an autoimmune response that targets melanocytes, driving progressive skin depigmentation.
Pathogenesis
Vitiligo is a multifactorial disorder characterized by the loss of functional melanocytes. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. These include genetic, autoimmune responses, oxidative stress, generation of inflammatory mediators and melanocyte detachment mechanisms. Both innate and adaptive immunity of the immune system appear to be play role.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of vitiligo is primarily made on clinical grounds and is based on history, clinical presentation, and family history (vitiligo, autoimmune disorders). The most extensively characterized clinical markers of active, progressive disease include: Koebner’s phenomenon, trichrome lesions, inflammatory lesions and confetti-like depigmentation.
Treatment
The optimal treatment of vitiligo will first depend on the subtype of the disease, percent of body surface area (BSA) involved, effect on quality of life, and the perception of the patient concerning the risk to benefit ratio. These treatments include phototherapy, topical and systemic immunosuppressants, and surgical techniques, stabilizing depigmented lesions and stimulating repigmentation. A successful treatment regimen to treat vitiligo incorporates three distinct approaches: reducing melanocytes stress, regulating the autoimmune response, and stimulating melanocyte regeneration.
""Vitiligo - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Vitiligo pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Vitiligo treatment guidelines. The assessment part of the report embraces, in depth Vitiligo commercial assessment and clinical assessment of the pipeline products under development. In the report, detailed description of the drug is given which includes mechanism of action of the drug, clinical studies, NDA approvals (if any), and product development activities comprising the technology, Vitiligo collaborations, licensing, mergers and acquisition, funding, designations and other product related details.
Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Vitiligo R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches to treat/improve Vitiligo.
• In September 2020, TAGCyx biotechnologies entered into a research collaboration with CAGE Bio for development of TAGX-0003 for treatment of dermatological autoimmune skin diseases. TAGX-0003 is a DNA aptamer possessing potent IFN-?antagonistic activity developed by TAGCyx and has already shown effective data in humanized autoimmune skin disease animal model such as alopecia areata when intra-dermally injected.
Vitiligo Emerging Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Vitiligo report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase III, II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Vitiligo Emerging Drugs
• Ruxolitinib: Incyte Corporation 
Ruxolitinib is an orally bioavailable Janus-associated kinase (JAK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities. Ruxolitinib specifically binds to and inhibits protein tyrosine kinases JAK 1 and 2, which may lead to a reduction in inflammation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation. The therapy is currently under Phase III clinical development for the treatment of vitiligo.
• AMG-714: Amgen 
AMG-714, a fully human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody (IgG1?), binds to and inhibits the function of IL-15 in all of its forms (Cis, Trans, and soluble IL-15 bound to IL-15RA), and blocks IL-15-induced T cell proliferation. The molecule is currently in Phase II clinical evaluation for the treatment of vitiligo.

Psoriasis Understanding
Psoriasis: Overview
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is accompanied with various clinical manifestations and is caused due to the involvement of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. It is a non-contagious dermatosis disease affecting almost 2% of the world population. The percentage of body affected by psoriasis can vary on an individual basis. It is possible to observe mild (<2%), moderate (2–10%), and severe (>10%) psoriasis in different people, however the most commonly witnessed psoriasis is chronic plaque psoriasis or psoriasis vulgaris. It is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder in which the dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and keratinocytes lead to skin lesions. Topical therapies are the standard of care for the treatment of mild to moderate form of the disease.
Psoriasis Types
• Plaque psoriasis
• Guttate psoriasis
• Flexural (inverse) psoriasis
• Erythroderma
• Generalised pustular psoriasis
• Palmoplantar pustulosis
• Psoriatic nail disease
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of psoriasis is found to be mostly on a clinical basis. The hallmarks observed in case of patients affected with psoriasis are well-demarcated, symmetric, and erythematous plaques with overlying silvery scale. Plaques can be seen typically in areas such as scalp, trunk, buttocks, and extremities but can also occur anywhere on the body. Patients can also depict nail involvement that can be present without concomitant plaques.
Treatment
A major population of patients can get benefitted from the topical therapies; this can also be initiated at the primary care level. If these particular topical agents do not provide an adequate response, the patients can be further referred to a dermatologist, at this particular point systemic therapy with topical adjuncts might be more beneficial. Presence of psoriatic arthritis involves systemic therapies in collaboration with a rheumatologist.

Psoriatic Arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints that can be associated with the psoriasis. It can affect both peripheral joints and axial skeleton causing pain, stiffness, swelling and joint destruction. This joint pathology develops gradually and cause more nuisance than disabling. Psoriatic arthritis is considered as seronegative spondyloarthropathies. The fact that it is Seronegative is that the blood tests negative for some factors that is present in rheumatoid arthritis. Spondyloarthropathy describes a group of conditions that all share common characteristics. First, there is a presence of arthritis that affects the spine.

Radiodermatitis Understanding
Radiodermatitis: Overview
Radiation dermatitis is a side effect of external beam ionizing radiation. It is also known as radiodermatitis, x-ray dermatitis, radiation skin damage or a radiation burn. Most commonly, radiation-induced dermatitis is caused by radiotherapy for underlying malignancies. It may also occur due to the exposure to radiation during interventional procedures such as coronary angiography, embolization procedures, and indwelling catheter placements. Irradiation of the skin leads to a complex pattern of direct tissue injury involving damage to cells of the epidermis and endothelial cells within the walls of blood vessels, and inflammatory cell recruitment. Many small studies have investigated the use of topical therapies, as either preventative agents or for management of skin reactions as they occur.

Refractory Metastatic Melanoma Understanding
Refractory Metastatic Melanoma: Overview
Refractory metastatic melanoma is the neoplasm of the melanocytes (melanin producing cells). Though melanoma is not common but are the most serious type of skin cancer. Melanoma can develop anywhere on the skin, it can also occur in eyes and other parts of body and on very rare occasions in intestine. Metastatic melanoma can invade the lymphatic system and spread. Exact cause of melanoma is still unclear, however the mutation in DNA of melanocyte due to exposure to UV rays, and other environmental factors are likely to be the leading cause for melanomas. Melanomas can affect both sexes equally. Individuals with history of sunburn, weakened immune system, many moles or unusual moles on the body, excessive exposure to the ultraviolet radiations, and family-history of melanoma are more prone to develop metastatic melanoma.

Seborrhoeic Dermatitis Understanding
Seborrhoeic Dermatitis: Overview
Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory dermatologic condition that usually affects the areas of the body with a large density of sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Overall, it has been reported to affect about 4% of the population. The cause of seborrheic dermatitis is not completely understood but it is thought to be triggered by the overgrowth of a harmless yeast called Malassezia that lives on the skin, or an overreaction by the skin’s immune system to this yeast. The diagnosis is based on the location and appearance of rash or lesion. Skin biopsy may be helpful but is rarely indicated. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is managed with treatment that reduces the level of skin yeast – these include creams and shampoo, which can be used safely on a long-term basis.
""Seborrhoeic Dermatitis- Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Seborrhoeic Dermatitis pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Seborrhoeic Dermatitis treatment guidelines.

Seborrhoeic Dermatitis Emerging Drugs
• Topical roflumilast foam (ARQ-154): Arcutis Biotherapeutics
Topical roflumilast foam (ARQ-154) is a foam formulation of a highly potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor (roflumilast).  Roflumilast has shown greater potency based on IC50 values (a non-clinical measure of a drug’s potency) than any other disclosed PDE4 inhibitor.  PDE4 is an intracellular enzyme that increases the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and decreases production of anti-inflammatory mediators and has been implicated in a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Arcutis has initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate topical roflumilast foam for seborrheic dermatitis.
• Omiganan (CLS002): Cutanea Life Sciences
Chitosan (CLS002), an implantable bioresorbable gel based on chitin and chitosan to treat soft tissue abnormalities of the skin. It is in phase II of clinical trials for the treatment of Seborrhoeic Dermatitis.
• DBI-002: DermBiont
Mechanism of Action: Microbiome modulators. The drug is in preclinical studies for the treatment of Seborrhoeic Dermatitis.
• PAC-14028: Amorepacific
PAC-14028 was developed as a transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) antagonist. It is known that TRPV1 might be deeply associated with skin permeability barrier function, suggesting that modulation of TRPV1 might be beneficial for the skin disorders with barrier damages. Amorepacific developed a topical cream formulation of PAC-14028. AC-14028 participated in phase II clinical trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy in seborrheic dermatitis

Sepsis Understanding
Sepsis: Overview
Sepsis is a life-threatning organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is sometimes called septicaemia or blood poisoning. If not recognized early, it can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death. It is most frequently a serious complication of infection, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where it represents a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Implementing preventive measures against infections, such as good hygiene practices, ensuring access to vaccination programs, improved sanitation and water quality and availability, and other infection prevention and control best practices both in the community and health care settings, are key steps in reducing the occurrence of sepsis.
Symptoms
There are three stages of sepsis which are sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Symptoms of sepsis includes:
• Fever above 101ºF (38ºC) or a temperature below 96.8ºF (36ºC)
• Heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute
• Breathing rate higher than 20 breaths per minute
• Probable or confirmed infection
Severe sepsis occurs if the original sepsis remains untreated or remains unresponsive to treatments. Severe sepsis will occur when the sepsis is affecting the function of an organ.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of sepsis demands a high level of suspicion, through the study of history and physical examination, appropriate laboratory checkups, and close follow-up of hemodynamic status of the patient.
Treatment
Sepsis is a medical emergency. It needs to be treated as such. Sepsis should be treated as quickly and efficiently as possible as soon as it has been identified. Treatment includes rapid administration of antibiotics and fluids. The risk of death from sepsis increases by an average of up to 7.6% with every hour that passes before treatment begins.

Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) Understanding
Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): Overview
Chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy (CIPN) is a predominantly sensory neuropathy that may be accompanied by motor and autonomic changes. CIPN is a major dose-limiting side effect of several first-line chemotherapeutic agents. Given the prevalence of common cancers treated with chemotherapeutics, CIPN annually affects several million patients worldwide. Due to its high prevalence among cancer patients and negative impact on their quality of life, CIPN constitutes a major problem for both cancer patients and survivors, as well as for their health care providers.
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) include:
• Tingling (“pins and needles”)
• Pain, which may be severe and constant
• Decreased sensation (“legs feel like jelly”)
• Increased sensitivity to touch, temperature, pressure, pain
• Muscle weakness
• Irreversible nerve damage
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Chemotherapy induced neuropathies is based on history, clinical examination and supporting laboratory investigations. These include electromyography with nerve conduction studies, skin biopsies to evaluate cutaneous nerve innervation, and nerve and muscle biopsies for histopathological evaluation.
Treatment
Treatment of chemotherapy induced neuropathies depends on discontinuation or lowering the dose of the anti-cancer drug. Treatment for Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is based on the severity of symptoms and includes combination of pain medications, vitamins, lotions and exercise. Persistent neuropathic pain can be treated with anti-seizure medications, antidepressants, or analgesics including opiate drugs. Commonly used medications include Lyrica, Neurontin, Cymbalta, Celebrex, Elavil, and Lipoderm Patch. Regular exercise, occupational and physical therapy, reducing alcohol use, and treating preexisting medical conditions (vitamin B12 deficiency) may reduce the risk of CIPN.

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Understanding
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: Overview
Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by diabetes. When it affects the arms, hands, legs and feet, it is known as diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is different from peripheral arterial disease (poor circulation), which affects the blood vessels rather than the nerves. Three different groups of nerves can be affected by diabetic neuropathy:
• Sensory nerves, which enable people to feel pain, temperature and other sensations
• Motor nerves, which control the muscles and give them their strength and tone
• Autonomic nerves, which allow the body to perform certain involuntary functions, such as sweating

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy does not emerge overnight. Instead, it usually develops slowly and worsens over time. Some patients have this condition long before they are diagnosed with diabetes. Having diabetes for several years may increase the likelihood of having diabetic neuropathy. The loss of sensation and other problems associated with nerve damage make a patient prone to developing skin ulcers (open sores) that can become infected and may not heal. This serious complication of diabetes can lead to loss of a foot, a leg or even a life.

Symptoms
If a person has peripheral neuropathy, his/her feet, legs, hands, or arms may feel:
• burning
• tingling, like “pins and needles”
• numb
• painful
• weak
The person may feel extreme pain in feet, legs, hands, and arms, even when they are touched lightly. They may also have problems sensing pain or temperature in these parts of their body. Symptoms are often worse at night. Most of the time, the patients will have symptoms on both sides of their body.


Diagnosis
To diagnose diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the foot and ankle surgeon will obtain the patient’s history of symptoms and will perform simple in-office tests on the feet and legs. This evaluation may include assessment of the patient’s reflexes, ability to feel light touch and ability to feel vibration. In some cases, additional neurologic tests may be ordered.
Treatment
First and foremost, treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy centers on control of the patient’s blood sugar level. In addition, various options are used to treat the painful symptoms. Medications are available to help relieve specific symptoms, such as tingling or burning. Sometimes a combination of different medications is used. In some cases, the patient may also undergo physical therapy to help reduce balance problems or other symptoms.

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) Understanding
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD): Overview
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disorder in which clusters of cysts develop within kidneys, causing them to enlarge and lose function over time. Cysts are noncancerous round sacs containing fluid. The cysts vary in size, and they can grow very large. PKD cysts can slowly replace much of the kidneys, reducing kidney function and leading to kidney failure. Polycystic kidney disease can also cause cysts to develop in other body parts like liver. PKD varies greatly in its severity, and some complications are preventable.
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) include:
• Back or side pain
• An increase in the size of the abdomen
• Blood in the urine
• Frequent bladder or kidney infections
• High blood pressure
• Kidney stones
• Fluttering or pounding in the chest
• Urinary tract or kidney infections
Diagnosis
Ultrasound is the most reliable, inexpensive and non-invasive way to diagnose Polycystic kidney disease (PKD). A CT scan (computed tomography scan) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may detect smaller cysts that cannot be found by an ultrasound. MRI is used to measure and monitor volume and growth of kidneys and cysts. Genetic testing is recommended where diagnosis based on imaging tests is uncertain.
Treatment
Treatment of people with the disease focuses on managing symptoms and treating complications. Prompt treatment with antibiotics of a bladder or kidney infection may help. Medication to control pain and a healthy lifestyle with regard to smoking cessation, exercise, weight control and reduced salt intake and drinking lots of plain water throughout the day help in slowing down the progression of disease. In 2018, the FDA approved tolvaptan (brand name Jynarque) as a treatment for ADPKD. Controlling high blood pressure can also delay the progression of the disease and slow further kidney damage.

Atrophic Vaginitis Understanding
Atrophic Vaginitis: Overview
Vaginal atrophy (also called atrophic vaginitis) is a condition where the lining of the vagina gets drier and thinner.Atrophic vaginitis, a vaginal disorder that usually happens after menopause when estrogen levels fall.Estrogen, which is produced by the ovaries, plays a vital role in keeping vaginal tissues lubricated and healthy.The condition also includes urinary tract problems such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) and frequent urination.Women age 50 and over, in menopause, are the most likely to experience vaginal atrophy. Surgical removal of the ovaries before the age of natural menopause, treatment with medications used to decrease estrogen levels in women who have conditions such as uterine fibroids or endometriosis,breastfeeding are common conditions with low estrogen levels leading to Atrophic Vaginitis.
Symptoms
? Dryness of the vagina.
? Burning and/or itching of the vagina.
? Dyspareunia 
? A discharge from the vagina – usually a yellow color.
? Spotting or bleeding.
? Vulvar itching (pruritus).
? Painful urination
Diagnosis
Atrophic Vaginitis can be diagnosed with careful physical examination of signs and symptoms associated.Occasionally laboratory tests are required to differentiate vaginal atrophy from other conditions such as:Pap test,Urine sample,Ultrasound, Serum hormone testing, Vaginal pH, Microscopy.
 Treatment
Treatments range from over-the-counter moisturizers to prescription-only hormone therapy. The treatment for atrophic vaginitis focuses on increasing estrogen levels and providing symptomatic relief. Vaginal cream, estrogen Replacement Therapy.

Achondroplasia Understanding
Achondroplasia: Overview
Achondroplasia (also called: ACH, Achondroplasia Dwarfism) is the most commonly occurring abnormality of bone growth (skeletal dysplasia) and is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. The word for word translation of ‘Achondroplasia’ is “without cartilage formation.” Cartilage is a robust but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. However, in Achondroplasia the problem is not in forming cartilage but in converting it to bone (a process called ossification), especially in the long bones of the arms and legs. This condition is similar to another skeletal disorder called Hypochondroplasia, but the features of Achondroplasia tend to be more severe.
Symptoms of Achondroplasia
The characteristic features of Achondroplasia include:-
• An average-size trunk
• Short arms and legs with particularly short upper arms and thighs
• Limited range of motion at the elbows
• An enlarged head (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead
• Fingers that are typically short; the ring finger and middle finger may diverge, giving a hand a three-pronged (trident) appearance.
The health problems commonly associated with Achondroplasia include:-
• Episodes in which breathing slows or stops for short periods (apnea)
• Obesity
• Recurrent ear infections.

Causes of Achondroplasia
Achondroplasia is caused by a gene alteration (mutation) in the FGFR3 gene. The FGFR3 gene makes a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 that is involved in converting cartilage to bone. FGFR3 is the only gene known to be associated with Achondroplasia.

The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Two specific mutations in the FGFR3 gene are responsible for almost all cases of Achondroplasia. Researchers believe that these mutations cause the FGFR3 protein to be overly active, which interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth seen with this disorder.

In approximately 80% of patients, Achondroplasia occurs as a result of a spontaneous genetic mutation; and in the remaining 20%, it is inherited from a parent.

Treatment
Currently, there is no way to prevent or treat Achondroplasia, since the majority of cases result from unexpected new mutations.

Treatment with growth hormone does not substantially affect the height of an individual with Achondroplasia. Leg-lengthening surgeries may be considered in some particular cases. Detection of bone abnormalities, particularly in the back, is important to prevent breathing difficulties and leg pain or loss of function. Kyphosis (or hunch-back) may need to be surgically corrected if it does not disappear when the child begins walking.

Surgery may also help in the treatment of bowing of legs. Ear infections need to be treated immediately to avoid the risk of hearing loss. Dental problems may need to be addressed by an orthodontist (a dentist with specialized training in the alignment of teeth).

Children born with Achondroplasia need to have their height, weight, and head circumference monitored using special growth curves standardized for Achondroplasia.Measures to avoid obesity at an early age are recommended.

Achondroplasia Emerging Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Achondroplasia report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.
Achondroplasia Emerging Drugs
• BMN-111: BioMarin Pharmaceutical
BioMarin has developed BMN-111 (vosoritide), an investigational drug derived from a natural human peptide that is a positive regulator of bone growth. Vosoritide binds to a specific receptor, which initiates intracellular signals that inhibit the overactive FGFR3 pathway. The investigational treatment is being studied in children with Achondroplasia under the age of 18 because their bones are still amenable to growth.
• Infigratinib: QED Therapeutics (BridgeBio)
Infigratinib (previously known as BGJ398) is an investigational, orally-administered, ATP-competitive, FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in development for the treatment of patients with FGFR-driven diseases, including cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer), and Achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder in children; Infigratinib is not chemotherapy.

QED Therapeutics holds worldwide rights to evaluate its safety and efficacy for multiple FGFR-driven diseases.

• TA-46: Pfizer

TA-46 (Recifercept) is an investigational, soluble recombinant human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) decoy, a mechanism of action that is believed to normalize the overactive FGFR3 signaling pathways that underlie bone development abnormalities associated with Achondroplasia. Therachon was developing TA-46 as a weekly subcutaneous injection for children and adolescents living with the condition. However, In May 2019, Pfizer has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the shares of Therachon Holding with assets in development for the treatment of Achondroplasia. TA-46 has completed Phase I and has received Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Preclinical data in the mouse model show the ability of TA-46 to restore bone growth and metabolism defects that are associated with Achondroplasia. The Phase I clinical trial started in 2018 and the first participant has already been dosed. In Phase I clinical trials healthy participants are dosed with the drug (in this case TA-46), so no therapeutic effect is expected from this trial, where the objective is to assess if the drug is safe to administer in a patient and its pharmacokinetics.

• CNP-ELP: PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals is developing CNP-ELP for the treatment of Achondroplasia. At present, it is in the preclinical stage of development. The C-type natriuretic peptide, or CNP, is a regulator of bone growth and can rescue defects in fibroblast growth factor 3 that cause Achondroplasia resulting in dwarfism. Native CNP has a half-life of less than 3 min, limiting its use as a direct therapeutic. CNP-ELP product candidate is being developed to deliver therapeutic levels of CNP with once-weekly subcutaneous injections. In a mouse model, they observed a demonstrated effect on linear growth when the CNP-ELP product candidate was injected once every 4 days.

• TransCon CNP: Ascendis Pharma
TransCon CNP is an investigational prodrug of CNP in development for the treatment of ACH in children. Designed to provide continuous CNP exposure, the goal of TransCon CNP is to optimize efficacy with a safe and convenient once-weekly dose. TransCon CNP has orphan designation for the treatment of ACH in both the U.S and Europe.

Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) Understanding
Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC): Overview
Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive, life-threatening liver disease, which typically leads to liver failure. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In patients with PFIC, liver cells have a diminished ability to secrete bile due to mutations in proteins that control bile flow. Mutations in the ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4 genes can cause PFIC. These mutations in different hepato-canalicular transporters lead to intrahepatic cholestasis (bile accumulation in the liver). Cellular bile accumulation leads to hepatocyte death.
Symptoms 
Signs and symptoms of PFIC typically begin in infancy and are related to bile buildup and liver disease. The symptoms of Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) include:
• Pruritus (itching)
• Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
• Failure to gain weight (failure to thrive)
• Portal hypertension 
• Enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)
• Cirrhosis
• Liver cancer
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is made based upon a liver function tests, imaging test and /or biopsy. A liver function tests, are blood tests used to check the state of the liver or biliary system. Ultrasound, CT scan or MRI may be done to check the liver or biliary system. A liver biopsy may be done to check the liver tissue. A highly specialized test measuring bile salt levels may be done to specifically check for PFIC. Genetic testing can reveal exactly mutated gene and provide information about the severity of the disease.
Treatment
Treatment for Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is medical therapy, surgery and liver transplant. Ursodiol (also called ursodeoxycholic acid or UDCA) reduces elevated liver enzymes by easing bile flow through the liver. Rifampin (also called rifampicin) can be used to treat pruritus. Vitamin supplements can be taken in order to replenish the vitamins A, D, E, and K that are not being properly absorbed by the body through the bile. Liver transplantation may be necessary if liver failure or liver cirrhosis occurs.

Multiple System Atrophy Understanding
Multiple System Atrophy: Overview
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting body's autonomic nervous system (involuntary action such as blood pressure or digestion) and movement. The symptoms reflect the progressive loss of function and death of different types of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. MSA causes deterioration and shrinkage (atrophy) of portions of your brain (cerebellum, basal ganglia and brainstem) that regulate internal body functions, digestion and motor control. MSA, formerly known as Shy–Drager syndrome, is an alpha-synuclein-related pathology like Parkinson’s disease. Alpha-synuclein accumulates in the glia in MSA, while in Parkinson’s disease, it accumulates in the neurons.
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Multiple System Atrophy include:
• Rigid muscles
• Difficulty bending your arms and legs
• Slow movement (bradykinesia)
• Impaired movement and coordination
• Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or chewing
• Postural (orthostatic) hypotension
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy is based upon a thorough clinical examination, with various autonomic tests and imaging studies. Tests may first be performed to rule out other causes of symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET), using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to measure regional brain glucose metabolism, is being developed as a tool to differentiate between degenerative parkinsonian conditions. Blood tests and brain imaging scans, such as an MRI, can show signs that may suggest MSA. 
Treatment
Treatment for Multiple System Atrophy is aimed at controlling the symptoms of the disease and includes medications and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms. Droxidopa effectively reduces neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Fludrocortisone also may be beneficial, but patients with MSA may become resistant to the drug after six months. In addition to levodopa, other drugs used to treat Parkinson’s disease may be used to treat individuals with MSA. These include dopamine agonists such as ropinirole (Requip) and pramipexole (Mirapexin) and an antiviral drug known as amantadine (Symmetrel). The drug midodrine hydrochloride (ProAmatine) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of low blood pressure sometimes associated with MSA.

Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Understanding
Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: Overview
Chronic Urticaria (CU) conventionally refers to recurrent wheals, on most days of the week, which occur for a period of ? six weeks. CU can be further divided into two different subtypes, namely, chronic idiopathic urticaria (also called chronic spontaneous urticaria) and chronic inducible urticaria (also called physical urticaria). In most patients, CU is a sporadic and self-limited disorder. Chronic spontaneous urticaria refers to chronic urticaria that has no specific cause or trigger. Wheals are present on most days of the week for 6 weeks or more. Chronic spontaneous urticaria was previously referred to as chronic idiopathic urticaria. This term is no longer used as many cases have an autoimmune basis.
Symptoms
Some patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria report associated systemic symptoms. These may include:
• Headache and fatigue
• Joint pain and swelling
• Wheezing, flushing, and palpitations
• Gastrointestinal symptoms

Pathophysiology
The wheal and angioedema associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria are caused by active and degranulating mast cells with the release of histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, eosinophil and neutrophilic chemotactic factors, platelet-activating factor, and cytokines. The mast cell mediators lead to vasodilation and an increase in vascular permeability with the resultant formation of urticaria. Autoimmunity plays a major role and is the main underlying mechanism. Chronic idiopathic urticaria can be caused either by IgE autoantibodies against auto-allergens or IgG autoantibodies directed against the mast cells high-affinity receptor Fc-epsilon-RI and/or IgE. The concept of autoimmunity originated from the observation that thyroid disorders and thyroid autoantibodies are more prevalent in CU patients.  

Treatment
There is no ‘cure’ for chronic urticaria. The goal of treatment is to achieve symptom-free control.

The approach to the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria can involve:
• Identification and elimination of any underlying causes
• Avoidance of any known aggravating factors, such as NSAIDs
• Pharmacological treatment to prevent mast cell mediator release, or to prevent the effects of mast cell mediators.

Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Emerging Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.
Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Emerging Drugs
• CT-P39:  Celltrion
CT-P39, a biosimilar of omalizumab (Xolair) is a humanised anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody. The drug is being developed by Celltrion, In July 2019, Celltrion announced that it is planning to launch first clinical trial of CT-P39. The company says that it plans to enter phase 3 trials in the first half of 2021 and has plans to commercialize the biosimilar by 2022.

• UB-221: United BioPharma
UB-221 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets IgE and leads to both neutralize free IgE and down-regulate IgE synthesis via CD23 on B cells. UB-221 not only neutralizes free IgE but also down-regulates IgE synthesis which Xolair cannot achieve. LUB-221 neutralizes free IgE more effectively than Xolair® with a binding affinity 8-fold higher than that of Xolair®. The serum half-life of UB-221 doubles that of Xolair® in monkey studies
• Ligelizumab: Novartis
Ligelizumab is a next-generation high-affinity humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody designed for the treatment of severe asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria. It binds to IGHE an acts as an immunomodulator. This drug was developed by Novartis Pharma AG. Research funded by Novartis Pharma after several clinical trials results the company concluded that Ligelizumab was more effective in treating chronic spontaneous urticaria than omalizumab. The drug is currently in phase III stage of development for the treatment of CIU.
• Antolimab: Allakos
Antolimab is an investigational, non-fucosylated IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting Siglec-8. By targeting Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor, antolimab blocks multiple inflammatory pathways. In clinical and preclinical studies, binding of antolimab to Siglec-8 induces inhibition of mast cells, apoptosis of tissue eosinophils, and depletion of blood eosinophils by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Antolimab is being developed in several mast cell and eosinophil driven diseases, and has demonstrated positive clinical activity in chronic urticaria.
• SYN008: Synermore Biologics
SYN008 is a biosimilar of Omalizumab (Xolair; a humanized anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody). It binds to the free IgE molecules in serum, thereby blocking the interaction between IgE and effector cells, which trigger the allergic response irrespective of allergen type. Stringent comparability studies between SYN008 and Omalizumab have been conducted and the investigational new drug (IND) application of SYN008 has been filed to the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in Oct 2014. The phase I clinical trial has been completed in Australia in Sep 2016.
• LY 3454738: Eli Lilly and Company

Macular telangiectasia Understanding
Macular telangiectasia: Overview
Macular telangiectasia (MacTel) is a disease affecting the macula, causing loss of central vision. MacTel develops when there are problems with the tiny blood vessels around the fovea. There are two types of MacTel, Type 1 MacTel and Type 2 MacTel. In MacTel type 1, the blood vessels become dilated and leads to tiny aneurysms, causing swelling and damaging macular cells. The disease almost always occurs in one eye, which differentiates it from Type 2. Type 2 MacTel is the most common form. In MacTel type 2 the capillaries around the fovea widen (become dilated) and leak. This causes fluid build-up and swelling, impairing reflection of light and causing progressive vision loss. As damage continues, new blood vessels may form, which can break and leak. This can lead to the development of scar tissue, further impairing central vision. MacTel type 2 affects both eyes and occurs most often in middle-aged adult.
Symptoms 
In the early stages, people with MacTel will have no symptoms. As the disease progresses, blurring, distorted vision, and loss of central vision are common. Loss of central vision progresses over a period of 10 – 20 years. MacTel does not affect side vision and does not usually cause total blindness.
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Macular telangiectasia is made based upon a thorough assessment of vision, and a variety of specialized tests. A small, fine crystals in the center of your macula is a sign of MacTel. Other findings are discoloration of the macula, abnormal blood vessels in the center of the macula, lipid (fat) deposits, and pigment clumps. Testing with an Amsler grid is done to detect any wavy or dark areas in central vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) are done to check the conditions of retina.
Treatment
Treatment options for Macular telangiectasia are limited. The variable course of progression of the disease makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of treatments. Treatment for MacTel in the absence of retinal neovascularization is supportive, as there is currently no proven therapy has been shown to prevent progression. Macular grid laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and intravitreal injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists have been tried. Currently there are new therapies under development for the treatment of Macular telangiectasia.

Meningioma Understanding
Meningioma: Overview
Meningioma is the most common intracranial tumor that originate from arachnoid cap cells present within the web -like membrane of the protective layer (meninges) covering the brain and spinal cord. Most meningiomas grow very slowly, often over many years without causing any symptoms. However, when grown to a considerable size can squeeze or compress the brain tissues, nerves, and vessels causing serious disability. According to WHO classification, based on the histology 15 variations of meningioma are recognized under 3 different grades depending on their growth rate, and likelihood of recurrence. Meningiomas are most common among women than men and often occur at older age. Although the main cause for meningioma is still unknown to the researchers but the two risk factors associated with meningioma are radiation exposure, and genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type II.
Symptoms
Symptoms can include headaches, seizures, hearing loss, blurred vision, language difficulty, memory loss, loss of smell, and weakness in muscle of arms and legs. 
Diagnosis
To diagnose meningiomas, neurosurgeons often recommend sophisticated imaging techniques such as CT scan, and MRI. In some cases, biopsy may be needed to rule out other tumors and confirm meningioma diagnosis.
Treatment
Treatment for meningioma depends on the size and location of the tumor as well as on the aggressiveness of the tumor. Most of the meningiomas progress slowly and are not diagnosed during the patient’s lifetime and do not require treatment. However, when the symptoms are visible surgeons recommend surgery. If meningiomas are not removed by surgery then radiation therapy is used to reduce the chances for recurrence. Chemotherapy is not widely used for the treatment of meningiomas but clinical trials and interventional developments are carried out to study the molecular targeted approaches.

Meningioma Emerging Drugs
• Gleolan: NX Devolopment Corp
NX development corp.’s drug, Gleolan also known as Aminolevulinic acid is an orally administered small molecule in development for the treatment and real time detection of meningioma. Gleolan is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the fluorescent molecule Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The exogenous application of ALA leads to a highly selective accumulation of PpIX in tumor cells. Following excitation with blue light. It is a photosensitizer molecule which can utilize the energy to induce photochemical reactions to produce lethal toxic agents; ultimately results in cell death and tissue destruction.
• Nivolumab: Bristol-Myers Squibb

Paranasal sinus cancer Understanding
Paranasal sinus cancer: Overview
Paranasal sinus cancer is a disease in which malignant tumor cells form in the tissues of paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.  The cancer can begin in the cells of membrane, bone, or nerves in the open spaces behind the nose. It is a type of head and neck cancer. Most common type of paranasal sinus cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. Being exposed to certain chemicals or dust deliberately increases the chances for developing paranasal sinus cancer.
Symptoms
Symptoms can include blocked sinuses, pain in sinus areas, nosebleeds, lump inside the nose that does not heal, and swelling or other trouble with the eyes, such as double vision or the eyes pointing in different directions. 
Diagnosis
Diagnosing Paranasal sinus cancer requires physical assessments of nose, face, and neck. Furthermore, clinicians also recommend screening procedures such as X-rays, MRI, CT scan, nasoscopy, laryngoscopy to view inside the nose for abnormal areas. Sometimes biopsy is also done to detect the presence of malignant cells inside the sinus cavity.
Treatment
Different types of treatments are available for patients with paranasal sinus cancer. The currently used treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy which comprises of administration of several approved drugs such as cisplatin, docetaxel, methotrexate, and others.

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) Understanding
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS): Overview
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a heightened defense response of the body to various stressful conditions to the body. It is nonspecific and can be caused by inflammation, ischemia, infection, trauma, sepsis, or other stresses combined. 
Symptoms
Clinically, symptoms of SIRS can be identified by two or more symptoms which would include hypothermia or fever, tachypnoea, tachycardia, and change in blood leucocyte count. 
Diagnosis
Diagnosing Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) may be done by assessing a range of tests that may include complete blood cell count, blood cultures, sputum gram stain and culture, urinalysis and culture, liver profiles, cardiac enzymes, venous or arterial blood gases, lactate, and other tests. Even though no imaging studies exist for SIRS, they may be prescribed based on etiology of the condition.
Treatment
Presently, there is no cure available for the treatment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). The treatment is majorly supportive and symptomatic. The management of symptoms is done by treating the underlying etiology.

Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer Understanding
Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer: Overview
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common type of cancer. The Microsatellite stable (MSS) Colorectal cancer, which exhibits chromosomal instability and accounts for 85% of tumor. They are caused by mutations in genes that are required to maintain chromosomal stability, leading to the accumulation of gains and losses of chromosomes (aneuploidy) as well as by structural chromosomal rearrangements.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
? Change in bowel habits
? Abdominal discomfort
? Rectal Bleeding 
? Change in the consistency of stool
? Diarrhea and constipation
Treatment
Microsatellite stable colorectal cancer bears fewer signals that alert the immune system to cancer. So checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, have been unsuccessful in treating MSS colorectal cancer (CRC).  Clinical trials have been going on to develop the promising drug for MSS colorectal cancer.

Opioid related disorder Understanding
Opioid related disorder: Overview
Opioids are a class of drugs that bind with the opioid receptor present on the central nervous system in the brain and body to reduce the sensation of pain. Opioids predominantly include prescription pain relievers, synthetic opioids, and heroines. Although opioids reduce the perception of pain but chronic use of opioids can cause distress and impairment. Opioid related disorder includes overpowering desire to use opioids, dependence, increased opioid tolerance, and addictions which represents the most severe form of the disorders. When discontinued, the individual suffers from withdrawal syndrome.
Symptoms
Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, weakened immune system, clogged blood vessels, hallucinations. Addicted people when discontinue opioids consumption often suffer from withdrawal symptoms which predominantly include anxiety, insomnia, agitations, muscle ache, tremors, and extreme mental and physical discomfort. 
Diagnosis
Opioid related disorder is diagnosed by clinicians by taking history, evaluating symptoms, using clinical information to identify a problematic pattern of opioid related impairment and distress as well as using 11 diagnostic criteria mentioned in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition.
Treatment
An effective treatment for opioid related disorder generally includes pharmacotherapy. Three FDA approved medications present for the treatment of individuals with opioid related disorder are naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine. These medications are more successful than other treatments for improving retention in addiction treatment.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis Understanding
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Overview
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis is an uncommon disorder that causes inflammation of the blood vessels in your nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder. It is the result of inflammation within the tissues called granulomatous inflammation and blood vessel inflammation (""vasculitis""), which can damage organ systems. The area’s most commonly affected by GPA include the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys, but any site can be affected. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis is nearly equally distributed between the sexes, with a slight male predominance. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis typically occurs in middle age, but is found in people of all ages. 
Symptoms
? Loss of appetite
? Weight loss
? Fever
? Fatigue
? Nasal or facial pain
? Nose bleeds or unusual nasal discharge, caused by inflammation of the nose or sinuses
? Chest discomfort with or without shortness of breath
? Joint pain
? Rashes or skin sores
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation including routine laboratory tests, a detailed patient history, identification of relevant symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. One way in the diagnosis of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis is by biopsying an involved organ and finding the pathologic features of this disease under the microscope. Chest X-rays, CT or MRI can help determine which blood vessels and organs are affected.Blood tests can check for: Signs of inflammation, Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anemia.

Treatment
Treatment generally involves taking prescription drugs long term to prevent relapse.With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it becomes easy to recover from granulomatosis with polyangiitis within a few months. Corticosteroids such as prednisone help suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation of the blood vessels. Rituximab (Rituxan) is another option for treating granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In cases of very serious granulomatosis with polyangiitis, plasmapheresis can help the kidneys recover.

Interstitial Lung Disease Understanding
Interstitial Lung Disease: Overview
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is another term for pulmonary fibrosis, which means “scarring” and “inflammation” of the interstitium (the tissue that surrounds the lung’s air sacs, blood vessels and airways). This scarring makes the lung tissue stiff, which can make breathing difficult. ILD may be limited to the lung, or it can be related to a condition that may affect other parts of the body, such as rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis.
Symptoms
Most people with ILD have symptoms that make breathing difficult, including:
• Shortness of breath
• Coughing, 
• Decreased exercise tolerance
• Fatigue
• Weight loss

Diagnosis
People with interstitial lung disease usually go to the doctor because of shortness of breath or a cough. The doctor will probably use imaging tests of your lungs to find out the problem. Such tests include- Chest X-ray, Lung function test, CT scan, and lung biopsy.
Treatment
The treatment you get depends on the type of ILD you have and its cause. Antibiotics are used to treat most interstitial pneumonias. Corticosteroids are used for some forms of interstitial lung disease, inflammation in your lungs causes damage and scarring.

Menorrhagia Understanding
Menorrhagia: Overview
Menorrhagia is heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding that lasts for more than 7 days. It limits normal activities, affects quality of life, and causes anaemia in two-thirds of women with objective menorrhagia. It can be caused due to: 
1. Problems related to uterine
• Growths or tumors of the uterus that are not cancer; these can be called uterine fibroids or polyps.
• Cancer of the uterus or cervix.
• Certain types of birth control—for example, an intrauterine device (IUD).
• Problems such as a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, can also cause abnormal bleeding. 
2. Hormone-related problems
3. Other illnesses 
• Bleeding-related disorders, such as von Willebrand disease (VWD) or platelet function disorder.
• Nonbleeding-related disorders such as liver, kidney, or thyroid disease; pelvic inflammatory disease; and cancer.
Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of menorrhagia may include:
• Soaking through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several consecutive hours
• Needing to use double sanitary protection to control your menstrual flow
• Needing to wake up to change sanitary protection during the night
• Bleeding for longer than a week
• Passing blood clots larger than a quarter
• Restricting daily activities due to heavy menstrual flow
• Symptoms of anemia, such as tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath

Diagnosis
Usually, menstrual bleeding lasts about 4 to 5 days and the amount of blood lost is small (2 to 3 tablespoons). However, women who have menorrhagia usually bleed for more than 7 days and lose twice as much blood. The doctor will ask about the medical history and bleeding cycles. The diagnosis involves one or more tests or procedures such as: blood test, pap test, endometrial biopsy, and ultrasound. Based on the results of primary tests, further tests such as Sonohysterography and Hysteroscopy can be recommended.

Treatment
The type of treatment is based on the cause of bleeding and its severity. Other factors such as age, medical history and overall health will also be considered. Treatment for hormone problems may include: Prostaglandin inhibitors are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including aspirin or ibuprofen. They help reduce cramping and the amount you bleed. Ablation, Hysterectomy Birth control pills helps to stop ovulation and result in lighter periods. Treatment for problems with the uterine lining (endometrium), hysterectomy, and iron supplements

Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) Understanding
Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS): Overview
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is a form of chronic lung allograft dysfunction that affects the majority of lung transplant recipients. It is the principal factor limiting long-term transplant survival. BOS is characterized by progressive airflow obstruction unexplained by acute rejection, infection, or other coexistent condition. Although BOS is a proven useful clinical syndrome that identifies patients at increased risk for death, its clinical course and underlying causative factors are now recognized to be increasingly heterogeneous.
Symptoms
Symptoms generally progress slowly over weeks to months. Common symptoms include:
• Shortness of breath and/or wheezing
• Decreased exercise or activity tolerance and endurance
• Fatigue
• Dry Cough

Causes
Bronchiolitis obliterans may result from lung injury caused by a variety of different chemicals and respiratory infections. Inhaled chemicals known to irritate the lungs and lead to the condition include chlorine; ammonia; oxides of nitrogen or sulfur dioxide; welding fumes; or food flavoring fumes (such as diacetyl). Respiratory infections caused by a respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, or Mycoplasma pneumonia have been linked with the condition. 
Pathogenesis
A better understanding of BOS pathogenesis is important if rational strategies are to be developed for its management. The histopathological features of BO suggest that injury and inflammation of epithelial cells and subepithelial structures of small airways lead to excessive fibro-proliferation due to ineffective epithelial regeneration and aberrant tissue repair. To support the basis for the pathogenesis of BOS two hypotheses have been proposed by several studies to explain the pathogenesis of chronic rejection which is alloimmune and non-alloimmune mechanisms. 

Treatment
Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) remains the major problem which ceases long-term survival after lung transplantation. Treatment and prevention of BOS are quite challenging. Currently, there is no approved or standard treatment for BOS and successful treatment is defined as stabilization or reduction in the rate of FEV1 decline. An important focus of treatment of BOS patients is optimizing immunosuppression to prevent further lung allograft rejection. Current treatment consists primarily of augmenting immunosuppression by changing medications within therapeutic classes, by adding medications, or by applying non-medicinal immuno-modulating therapies. An increasing number of induction and maintenance immunosuppressive agents have become available over time for use in various combinations allowing for more choice and personalization of immunosuppressive therapy. Despite several advancements, there are pros and cons to each immunosuppressive agent and a regimen that leads to prolonged survival yet is void of associated morbidity including infection, malignancy, and drug-related toxicities, etc. are still under regress research and development.

Adult-Onset Still Disease Understanding
Adult-Onset Still Disease: Overview
Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare inflammatory disorder that affects the entire body (systemic disease). The cause of the disorder is unknown (idiopathic). It has similar symptoms to systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis – fever, rash, and joint pain. The specific symptoms and frequency of episodes vary from one person to another and the progression of the disorder is difficult to predict. In some individuals, the disorder appears suddenly, disappears almost as quickly and may not return. In other people, adult-onset Still's disease is a chronic, potentially disabling, condition.
Symptoms
Most people with adult Still's disease have a combination of the following signs and symptoms: Fever, Rash, Sore throat, Achy and swollen joints, and Muscle pain. 
Diagnosis
Diagnosing AOSD is difficult because there are no specific tests or distinguishing laboratory (histopathologic) findings that differentiate the disorder from similar disorders. A diagnosis of AOSD is usually made based upon thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings, and the exclusion of other possible disorders (diagnosis of exclusion). A variety of tests may be performed to aid in the diagnosis, including blood tests and x-ray studies that reveal changes in the bones or joints or enlargement of the spleen or liver. An echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart, may reveal inflammation of the pericardium or myocardium.
Treatment
Many different therapies have been tried for individuals with adult-onset Still’s disease. No one treatment has proven consistently effective in all cases. A variety of different drugs taken alone or in combination may be used to treat affected individuals. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used to treat symptoms of inflammation. Fever, joint pain and bone pain have responded to treatment with these drugs. Other painkillers (analgesics) such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) may also be used. In 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ilaris (canakinumab) to treat patients with active Still’s disease, including adult onset Still’s disease.

Hypovolemia Understanding
Hypovolemia: Overview
Hypovolemia is a state of an abnormally decreased volume of circulating fluid (plasma) in the body. It may be caused by a rapid and substantial loss of blood or from dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhea, burns, severe environmental fluid losses, or drugs such as diuretics. Lost fluid in patients with dehydration is comprised primarily of plasma rather than whole blood as in the trauma patient. 
Symptoms 
Hypovolemia can be recognized by an elevated pulse, a diminished blood pressure, and the absence of perfusion as assessed through skin signs (skin turning pale) and/or capillary refill on forehead, lips and nail beds. The patient may feel dizzy, faint, nauseated, or very thirsty.
Diagnosis
Agoraphobia is diagnosed based on symptoms and signs a diagnosis. To be diagnosed with agoraphobia, symptoms need to meet certain criteria listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is a manual often used by healthcare providers to diagnose mental health conditions.  
Treatment
Psychotherapy, involves meeting with a therapist or other mental health professional on a regular basis to talk about fears and any issues that may be contributing to fears. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common form of psychotherapy used to treat people with agoraphobia. Certain medications are used to relieve agoraphobia or panic attack symptoms. These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine (Paxil) or fluoxetine (Prozac), selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine (Effexor) or duloxetine (Cymbalta), tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil) or nortriptyline (Pamelor), anti-anxiety medications, such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clonazepam (Klonopin).

Atopic Keratoconjuctivitis Understanding
Atopic Keratoconjuctivitis: Overview
Atopic Keratoconjuctivitis (AKC) is a noninfectious chronic inflammatory ocular-surface condition associated with other atopic conditions. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Atopic Keratoconjuctivitis include:
• Sensitivity to eye
• Itching
• Burning
• Tearing
• Red and hardened eyelids
Diagnosis
Atopic Keratoconjuctivitis usually is diagnosed by clinical exam and a medical and family history. A conjunctival biopsy may be helpful in distinguishing AKC from other conditions.
Treatment
Combinations of oral and topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers usually are effective in controlling symptoms. In more severe cases, there is potential for damage to the eye caused by scratching and rubbing. Cold compresses and saline irrigation to lower the elevated tear pH also may be helpful. Only in severe cases topical steroid therapy should be considered. Steroid-sparing agents such as cylosporine or tacrolimus may be helpful. Systemic treatment of the conditions that accompany AKC may be very helpful.

Vestibular Schwannoma Understanding
Vestibular Schwannoma: Overview
A vestibular schwannoma (also known as acoustic neuroma, acoustic neurinoma, or acoustic neurilemoma) is a benign, usually slow-growing tumor that develops from the balance and hearing nerves supplying the inner ear. The tumor comes from an overproduction of Schwann cells—the cells that normally wrap around nerve fibers like onion skin to help support and insulate nerves. As the vestibular schwannoma grows, it affects the hearing and balance nerves, usually causing unilateral (one-sided) or asymmetric hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), and dizziness/loss of balance. As the tumor grows, it can interfere with the face sensation nerve (the trigeminal nerve), causing facial numbness. Vestibular schwannomas can also affect the facial nerve (for the muscles of the face) causing facial weakness or paralysis on the side of the tumor. 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Vestibular Schwannoma include:
• Hearing loss
• Tinnitus
• Dizziness/ loss of balance
• Facial weakness or paralysis
• Swallowing difficulties
Diagnosis
Unilateral/asymmetric hearing loss and/or tinnitus and loss of balance/dizziness are early signs of a vestibular schwannoma. Unfortunately, early detection of the tumor is sometimes difficult because the symptoms may be subtle and may not appear in the beginning stages of growth. Once the symptoms appear, a thorough ear examination and hearing and balance testing (audiogram, electronystagmography, and auditory brainstem responses) are essential for proper diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are critical in the early detection of a vestibular schwannoma and are helpful in determining the location and size of a tumor and in planning its microsurgical removal. 
Treatment
There are three options for managing a vestibular schwannoma: (1) surgical removal, (2) radiation, and (3) observation. Sometimes, the tumor is surgically removed (excised). The exact type of operation done depends on the size of the tumor and the level of hearing in the affected ear. If the tumor is small, hearing may be saved and accompanying symptoms may improve by removing it to prevent its eventual effect on the hearing nerve. As the tumor grows larger, surgical removal is more complicated because the tumor may have damaged the nerves that control facial movement, hearing, and balance and may also have affected other nerves and structures of the brain. As an alternative to conventional surgical techniques, radiosurgery (that is, radiation therapy—the “gamma knife” or LINAC) may be used to reduce the size or limit the growth of the tumor. Radiation therapy is sometimes the preferred option for elderly patients, patients in poor medical health, patients with bilateral vestibular schwannoma (tumor affecting both ears), or patients whose tumor is affecting their only hearing ear.

Cardiovascular Calcification Understanding
Cardiovascular Calcification: Overview
Cardiovascular calcification is a process in which mineral deposits formed in vessel walls and heart valve leaflets and can lead to tissue stiffening, plaque rupture and heart failure. Several biological processes contribute to cardiovascular calcification, including extracellular vesicle release, matrix remodelling, loss of mineral-deposition inhibition, impaired mineral resorption, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and stem and progenitor cell programmes. It is a commonly observed but incompletely understood mechanism of increased atherosclerotic plaque instability and accelerated aortic valve stenosis.
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Cardiovascular Calcification is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Imaging tests, like CT, Intravascular ultrasound are used to quantify. Current methods for cardiovascular calcification imaging are mostly limited to advanced calcification and miss clinically relevant early microcalcifications. Implementation of advanced imaging tools and artificial intelligence might improve diagnostics and risk assessment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) also has high sensitivity and specificity to identify Coronary artery calcification.
Treatment
The goal in treating coronary calcification is to slow (and possibly reverse) its progression and prevent serious consequences such as heart attack or stroke. Controlling risk factors can help limit coronary calcification and prevent life-threatening disease. Treating Cardiovascular Calcification involves invasive surgeries and costly transcatheter procedures. Medicines like PCSK 9 inhibitors (eg, Repatha, Praluent) can help in lowering the cholesterol, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics can be taken to reduce blood pressure. New therapies are under clinical development, promising advanced treatment.
Cardiovascular Calcification Emerging Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Cardiovascular Calcification report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.
Cardiovascular Calcification Emerging Drugs
• SNF 472: Sanifit
SNF472 is a novel small molecule, and a selective and potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystallization, the final common pathway that leads to vascular calcification. Sanifit’s SNF 472 blocks calcification, with action independent of Ca/Phosphate levels. 
The therapy is in Phase 2b trial (CaLIPSO) to assess the effect of SNF472 on slowing arterial calcification, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in patients on dialysis.

Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome Understanding
Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome: Overview
Immunological deficiency syndromes are diseases or conditions in which there is a loss of or defect in a component of the immune system. Patients with these syndromes have an increased susceptibility to infections and to developing certain cancers. These syndromes include primary immune deficiency diseases, such as severe combined immunodeficiency, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are two types of immunodeficiency disorders: Primary and Secondary. Primary disorders are usually present at birth and are genetic disorders that are usually hereditary. The secondary disorders generally develop later in life and often result from use of certain drugs or from another disorder, such as diabetes or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
Symptoms 
People with an immunodeficiency disorder tend to have one infection after another. Usually, respiratory infections (such as sinus and lung infections) develop first and recur often. Most people eventually develop severe bacterial infections that persist, recur, or lead to complications. Infections of the mouth, eyes, and digestive tract are common. People with certain immunodeficiency disorders may have many large, noticeable warts (caused by viruses). Many people have fevers and chills and lose their appetite and/or weight. Abdominal pain may develop, possibly because the liver or spleen is enlarged. Other symptoms vary depending on the severity and duration of the infections.
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. Laboratory tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis of immunodeficiency and to identify the type of immunodeficiency disorder. Blood tests, skin tests and biopsy are helpful in diagnosis. Genetic testing will help in identifying any gene mutation or mutations that cause many immunodeficiency disorders.
Treatment
Treatment of immunodeficiency disorders usually involves preventing infections, treating infections when they occur, and replacing parts of the immune system that are missing when possible. Antimicrobials, such as antibiotics and antifungals, are medications that fight bacterial or fungal infections. Inability to produce adequate amounts or functional immunoglobulin or antibodies may benefit from replacement therapy with gamma globulins. Other treatments for some types of immune deficiencies are bone marrow transplants, hematopoietic cell transplantation, thymus transplantation, gene therapy, enzyme replacement and biologic cytokine inhibitors are examples of other treatments. Researchers in immunology are experimenting with gene therapy and other treatments that will be available in the future.

Cocaine Use Disorder Understanding
Cocaine Use Disorder: Overview
Cocaine is a tropane ester alkaloid found in leaves of the Erythroxylum coca plant. Cocaine is the world's most addictive drug. Cocaine Use Disorder is a condition characterized by the harmful consequences of repeated cocaine use, a pattern of compulsive cocaine use, and (sometimes) physiological dependence on cocaine (i.e., tolerance and/or symptoms of withdrawal). Cocaine use increases the levels of the natural chemical messenger called dopamine in the brain and prevented from re-cycling, which causes extra amounts to build up between nerve cells and because of this “flood” of dopamine, the normal brain communication is interrupted and causes the high that people get from cocaine. Cocaine use can lead to addiction and adverse physical effects, such as stroke and cardiac arrest. 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Cocaine Use Disorder include:
• Being unable to stop or limit use
• Craving cocaine
• Making a habit of using cocaine even though it causes problems
• Rapid increase in the amount of cocaine needed
• Regular use may result in irritability, exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, shaking, and sweating
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Cocaine Use Disorder is done by thorough examination of patient’s symptoms and health history along with physical examination. The disorder is only diagnosed when cocaine use becomes persistent and causes significant academic, occupational, social or medical impairment. Accurate diagnosis of this disorder requires assessment by a qualified practitioner trained in psychiatric diagnosis and evidence-based treatment.
Treatment
The first step in the treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder is to stop using cocaine. This is also known as detox. The second step is to change behaviors to stop from using the drug again. Treatment may be given in a rehabilitation program. Medicines like antidepressants, Topiramate and gabapentin to lower the risk of seizures, Methylphenidate, Baclofen, Modafinil, or Disulfiram can be given to ease withdrawal symptoms and lower the risk of using again. Behavioral Therapy may be used for cocaine withdrawal.

Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) Understanding
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP): Overview
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is a serious, life-threatening, genetic disorder and is characterized by the initial development of many tens to thousands of adenomas in the rectum and colon during the second decade of life. FAP is caused by a germ line mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The inheritance of FAP is autosomal dominant. FAP causes extra tissue (polyps) to form in large intestine (colon) and rectum. Polyps can also occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially the upper part of small intestine (duodenum). If untreated, the polyps in the colon and rectum are likely to become cancerous.
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) include:
• Blood or mucous in the stools
• Changes in bowel habits
• Abdominal pain
• Weight loss
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. Screening is done using sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and side-viewing duodenoscopy.  CT or MRI imaging of the abdomen and pelvis may be used, especially to evaluate desmoid tumors. Genetic testing can confirm the mutation and disease.
Treatment
Treatment of FAP Patients are managed through regular endoscopic surveillance. Polyps are controlled by polypectomy or ablation. Surgical options include: Colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis, Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis Proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy. A combination of medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-estrogen and chemotherapy is provided for desmoid tumors. Research is continue to evaluate additional treatments for FAP. Medications like sulindac (Clinoril®) and celecoxib (Celebrex®) have been shown to reduce the number of colorectal polyps and delay the timing of the first surgery. These medications can also control polyps in the pouch or rectum after surgery, or the need for additional surgeries.

Clear Cell Sarcoma Understanding
Clear Cell Sarcoma: Overview
Clear-cell sarcoma (CCS) is a rare tumor and preferentially arises in soft tissue in the extremities, sometimes referred to as “melanoma of the soft parts” based on evidence of melanocytic differentiation of these cells. Clear cell sarcoma gets its name from the fact that the cells of the tumor look clear under a microscope. Clear cell sarcoma tumors tend to grow attached to tendons in the limbs, especially in the feet and hands. They sometimes develop in the gastrointestinal tract, attached with the bottom layers of the skin, and in locations throughout the torso. Clear cell sarcoma is slightly more common in females than in males and can occur at all age, the mean age at the time of diagnosis is approximately 25 years. CCS is distinguished from malignant melanoma by the presence of a specific fusion of an oncogene EWS/ATF1, which results from a reciprocal translocation. 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Clear Cell Sarcoma include:
• Slow-growing lump 
• Fatigue
• Weight loss
• Loss of appetite
• Night sweats
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Clear Cell Sarcoma is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and pathological evaluation. Clear cell sarcoma tumors are often imaged by an MRI and CT scan. Biopsy is done to check, if the tumor is Clear Cell Sarcoma. Genetic testing confirm the diagnosis of Clear Cell Sarcoma.
Treatment
Therapies that are used to treat individuals with Clear Cell Sarcoma includes surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Two FDA approved chemotherapies used in the management of soft tissue sarcomas are ifosfamide and doxorubicin. The most promising experimental strategies for treating clear cell sarcoma are targeted therapies, which are designed to target specific features of cancer cells. One type of targeted therapy is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which blocks overactive signaling molecules in cancer cells that promote cancer growth.

Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy Understanding
Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy: Overview
Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a rare inflammatory disorder of the retina that leads to severe retinal scarring and blindness. The condition is characterized by the formation of cellular membrane on both surfaces of the retina and in the vitreous. It occurs after retinal detachment repair surgery or as a result of an open globe injury (trauma to the eyeball). Of all retinal detachment surgery cases, 5-10% develop proliferative vitreoretinopathy. When a person develops PVR, cells in the retina start to multiply and form scar tissue. The scar tightens and pulls the retina away.   
Symptoms 
The signs and symptoms of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy include:
• Loss of vision
• Retinal break
• Retinal traction  (pulling)
• Diffuse vitreous haze, pigment clumps or clusters on the retina
• Condensed vitreous strands
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy is based upon indirect ophthalmoscope, a primary method for diagnosing retinal detachment. B-scan ultrasonography can be used to determine the location and extent of a retinal detachment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) may be used to confirm the presence of subretinal fluid in the macula.
Treatment
Standard treatment for Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy is retinal surgery. Patients may undergo pars plana vitrectomy with peeling of membranes. To avoid the adverse effects associated with oral corticosteroids, topical and subconjunctival or retrobulbar repository steroids are used at the time of surgery for patients who are not steroid glaucoma responders. Research is ongoing to find medical therapies for the prevention and treatment of PVR.

Endocarditis Understanding
Endocarditis: Overview
Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle (endocardium) caused by bacteria, fungi, or germs that enter through the bloodstream. IE occurs most frequently in patients with abnormal (leaky or narrow) heart valves, artificial (prosthetic) heart valve or in people who have a pacemaker lead.  The endocardium covers the heart valves, and it is these valves which are primarily affected by infective endocarditis. If the infection remains untreated, multiplying bacteria may eventually destroy the valves and result in heart failure. 
Symptoms 
The presenting symptoms are a low-grade persistent fever without an obvious cause and fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion. Patients also may have joint pain (arthralgia) and muscle pain (myalgia) and their health care provider may hear a new or changing murmur. In addition, the following signs and symptoms occur: 
• Heart murmur not previously present or a changed heart murmur
• Flu-like symptoms including chills
• Chest pain while breathing
• Loss of appetite leading to weight loss
• Night sweats
• Pain nodules in the fingertips
Diagnosis
The key step in the diagnosis of endocarditis is obtaining blood cultures before antibiotics are started.  Diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be done based on pathology or by meeting certain clinical diagnostic criteria.  
Treatment
Therapeutic measures typically include intravenous infusion of high doses of appropriate antibiotic drugs. Antibiotic therapy is needed for at least six or eight weeks and is provided intravenously for at least 2 weeks and often for the entire treatment duration. The specific drugs or drug combinations used may depend upon the bacterium responsible for the infection and other factors (e.g., bacterial strain resistance to certain antibiotics). In patients with a prosthetic heart valve or other implanted material, surgery is almost always needed to remove the infected artificial material and repair the heart. Surgery also is needed if there is an abscess with blockage of the heart electrical signal, rupture between chambers of the heart, or persistent infection even with antibiotic therapy.

Lymphoedema Understanding
Lymphoedema: Overview
Lymphoedema is a chronic disease marked by the increased collection of lymphatic fluid in the body, causing swelling, which can lead to skin and tissue changes. The chronic, progressive accumulation of protein-rich fluid within the interstitium and the fibro-adipose tissue exceeds the capacity of the lymphatic system to transport the fluid. 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Lymphoedema include:
• Distal swelling in the extremities including the arms, hands, legs, feet; swelling proximally in the breast, chest, shoulder, pelvis, groin, genitals, face/intraoral tissues
• Restricted range of motion in the joints because of swelling and tissue changes
• Skin discoloration
• Pain and altered sensation
• Limb heaviness;
• Difficulty fitting into clothing 
Diagnosis
Lymphedema is often confused with other causes of extremity edema and enlargement. Diagnosis is suspected by evaluating the history and physical examination. Lymphoscintigraphy confirms the diagnosis. Imaging is unnecessary to make the diagnosis but can be used as confirmation, assessment of the extent of involvement, and help to determine therapeutic intervention. Newer technologies include 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), ultrasound, and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Ultrasound is useful to exclude other etiologies like DVT, venous insufficiency and can also help in identifying tissue changes and masses that might be the cause of lymphatic compression. CT and MRI can investigate soft tissue edema with good sensitivity and specificity, but they are relatively expensive.
Treatment
Lymphedema is a progressive disease, and early diagnosis and treatment are paramount. Critical to diagnose and treat both mild and early onset cases to halt the progression of this lifelong and often debilitating condition. For patients to improve their knowledge base and learn helpful evidence-based management and coping strategies, patients must be referred to a specialist holding certification in lymphedema treatment and management eg.physician, an occupational therapist, or physical therapist. Decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT): Is the primary treatment for moderate-to-severe lymphedema and mobilizes lymph and dissipate fibrosclerotic tissue. Manual lymph drainage (MLD): Light lymph massage designed to increase lymph flow. Compression: Helps with drainage but can increase the risk of infection. Skincare: Fastidious skin care is essential to prevent secondary skin infections. Exercise: Light exercise promotes lymph drainage and protein absorption via muscle contraction. Drug therapy acts as adjunctive only for pain control or secondary infection.

Trigeminal Neuralgia Understanding
Trigeminal Neuralgia: Overview
Trigeminal Neuralgia is a chronic neuropathic pain disorder characterized by spontaneous and elicited paroxysms of electric shock–like or stabbing pain in a region of the face. The pain of trigeminal neuralgia most frequently affects the distribution of the second (maxillary) or third (mandibular) division of the trigeminal nerve, with the right side of the face affected more often than the left side. Three types of trigeminal neuralgia have been delineated: classical, secondary, and idiopathic. Bilateral trigeminal neuralgia is rare and should raise concern about facial neuralgia due to an underlying neurologic disease or a non-neurologic disorder affecting the cranium. The incidence of trigeminal neuralgia is higher among women than among men and increases with age.
Symptoms 
The pain of Trigeminal Neuralgia can come in sharp spasms that feel like electric shocks. Pain generally occurs on one side of the face and may be brought on by sound or touch. Pain can be triggered by routine acts, including:  brushing teeth, shaving, touching face, eating or drinking, speaking, a breeze on face etc.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is clinical and is based on three main criteria: pain restricted to the territory of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve; paroxysms of pain that are sudden, intense, and very short. Diagnosis will depend on the type and location of the pain and factors that trigger the pain. 
Treatment
The anticonvulsant agents carbamazepine, in doses of approximately 200 to 1200 mg per day, and oxcarbazepine (300 to 1800 mg per day) have been considered the first-choice treatments for control of paroxysmal pain in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, regardless of the cause. Gabapentin, pregabalin, and antidepressant agents, which have been shown to be effective in the treatment of other neuropathic conditions characterized by continuous pain, may be tried as additional agents along with oxcarbazepine or carbamazepine. Microvascular decompression has become the surgical procedure that is now favored for most cases of trigeminal neuralgia that do not respond to medication.

Behçet disease Understanding
Behçet disease: Overview
Behçet disease is a rare disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation throughout the body. It is a complex, chronic, relapsing, multi-system inflammatory disorder that is characterized by oral ulcers, genital ulcers in addition to ocular and skin symptoms. Behcet’s is considered as a type of vasculitis, because it causes inflammation of blood vessels of nearly all sizes and types, including arteries and veins. The cause of Behçet disease is unknown, but it is presumed to be an autoimmune disorder.
Symptoms 
Signs and symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected. The general symptoms of commonly affected areas by Behçet disease include:
• Recurring genital sores
• Eye inflammation
• Skin sores 
• Mouth sores 
• Joint swelling and pain
• Malaise, generalized weakness
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Behçet disease is based upon the signs and symptoms, the finding of recurrent mouth ulcerations combined with any two of the following: eye inflammation, genital ulcerations, or skin abnormalities. Tests like blood tests or other laboratory tests are done to rule out other conditions. Pathergy test, a specialized skin test for Behçet's syndrome, is done to check immune reaction of body.
Treatment
The aim of treatment for Behçet disease is to control the pain and inflammatory process and depends on the severity and the location of its manifestations in an individual patient. Steroid (cortisone) gels, pastes (such as Kenolog in Orabase) and creams can be helpful for the mouth and genital ulcers. For anterior uveitis, topical corticosteroids combined with a cycloplegic agent are frequently used as a first line therapy. For posterior segment disease, or recalcitrant anterior uveitis, systemic therapy or local steroids are often prescribed. Biological therapies like infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira) are also used, particularly when traditional steroid sparing agents fail or there is an intolerance to medication. Research is ongoing to look for other biological therapies that have many potential advantages for the treatment of Behçet disease.

Anaphylaxis Understanding
Anaphylaxis: Overview
Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction to a trigger such as an allergy and involving the release of mediators from mast cells, basophils and recruited inflammatory cells. Anaphylaxis usually develops rapidly, reaching peak severity within 5 to 30 minutes, and may, rarely, last for several days. The term anaphylaxis is often reserved to describe immunological, especially IgE-mediated reactions. A second term, non-allergic anaphylaxis, describes clinically identical reactions that are not immunologically mediated. Allergies to food, insect stings, medications and latex are most frequently associated with anaphylaxis.
Symptoms 
Signs and symptoms of Anaphylaxis can be defined alone or in combination, which occur within minutes, or up to a few hours, after exposure to a provoking agent. The symptoms of Anaphylaxis depends on the type of allergy and the trigger and may include: feeling lightheaded or faint, nasal congestion, breathing difficulties (such as fast, shallow breathing), wheezing, clammy skin, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, collapsing or losing consciousness or swelling and itchiness of the skin etc.
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Anaphylaxis is made based upon a detailed review of patient’s allergic reactions history, and a variety of specialized tests. Diagnostic tests such as skin-prick tests, blood tests and oral food challenges are done to determine the particular triggers.
Treatment
Emergency treatment for an Anaphylaxis patient with a severe allergic reaction involves an injection of epinephrine, or adrenaline. Epinephrine IM or IV is the first line treatment. Avoidance of trigger is the most effective way to prevent anaphylaxis. In some cases oxygen, beta-agonist (such as albuterol), intravenous antihistamines and cortisone are used to relieve breathing symptoms. One might receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if the patient stop breathing or if his or her heart stops beating.

Still’s disease Understanding
Still’s disease: Overview
Still’s disease is a systemic autoinflammatory disease with a childhood form, known as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and a similar adult form, called adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD). The disease is characterized by high spiking fevers, salmon-colored rash that comes and goes, and arthritis. Still's disease accounts for 10%-20% of all cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. “Systemic” in the disease means it may affect not only the joints but other parts of the body, including the liver, lungs and heart. Still’s disease can occur any time during childhood, but it most commonly starts at about two years of age and boys and girls are equally affected.
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Still’s disease include:
• high fevers
• skin rashes
• sore throat
• joint inflammation and pain 
• muscle pain
• poor appetite
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Still’s disease is made based upon a thorough review of current symptoms, medical history and a physical examination. Blood tests can be used to rule out the presence of other diseases with similar symptoms. Tests that can aid in diagnosis include blood tests and x-rays, which reveal changes to the bones or joints, or enlargement to the spleen or liver. Laboratory tests show a marked inflammatory response with leukocytosis (neutrophilia), thrombocytosis, high C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Blood tests may also reveal certain changes associated with Still’s disease.
Treatment
The initial treatment for Still’s disease is aimed at controlling the symptoms of joint inflammation, pain and fever through anti-inflammatory drugs. Cortisone medications (steroids) such as prednisone are used to treat more severe features of illness. Methotrexate is often prescribed alongside corticosteroids as it allows lower doses of corticosteroids to be used. Other medicine that are used include hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. Recently, biological therapy are in use for the treatment like interleukin 1 blocker anakinra (Kineret), and interleukin 6 blocker Tocilizumab (Actemra). In 2021, the USFDA approved Ilaris (canakinumab) to treat patients with active Still’s disease, including adult onset Still’s disease. Some patient may undergo joint replacement surgery in severe cases.
Still’s disease Emerging Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Still’s disease report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase III, II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Schizoaffective disorder Understanding
Schizoaffective disorder: Overview
Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic mental health condition that involves symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder like major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. The two types of schizoaffective disorder are bipolar type and depressive type. The bipolar type includes both dramatic ""highs,"" called manic episodes, and ""lows,"" called depressive episodes. The depressive type includes only depressive episodes. The Depressive episodes are marked by low energy and activity, a feeling of hopelessness, and an inability to perform everyday tasks. Genetic and environmental factors can increase the risk of getting a mental illness.
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Schizoaffective disorder include:
• Delusions
• Hallucinations
• Impaired communication and speech
• Bizarre or unusual behavior
• Symptoms of depression
• Periods of manic mood
• Impaired occupational, academic and social functioning
• Problems with managing personal care
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder is based upon a thorough psychiatric evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. Tests may first be performed to rule out other mental health disorders and concluding that symptoms are not due to substance use, medication or a medical condition. Other imaging test like an MRI or CT scan may be done for detailed analysis.
Treatment
Treatment for Schizoaffective disorder includes a combination of medications, psychotherapy and life skills training. Treatment varies, depending on the type and severity of symptoms and whether the disorder is the depressive or bipolar type. Medication aims to relieve psychotic symptoms, stabilize mood and treat depression such as antipsychotics, mood-stabilizing medications, and antidepressants. In addition to medication, psychotherapy may help. For adults who do not respond to psychotherapy or medications, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered.

Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency Understanding
Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency: Overview
Adult growth hormone deficiency is a medical condition that occurs when the pituitary gland in brain does not produce enough growth hormone. Growth hormone is made by the anterior pituitary gland. It stimulates the release of another hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is produced mainly by the liver. Together, these hormones stimulate growth in childhood (especially the height) and in adult life psychological well-being and physical performance.GH also has widespread metabolic effects throughout the body. 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency include:
• Decrease in the amount of muscle bulk and strength
• Increase in the amount of fat  in the body (especially around the waist)
• Abnormalities of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ cholesterol. This can lead to an increase in the risk of heart disease
• Osteoporosis (brittle bones)
• Low energy levels and decreased stamina
• Impaired concentration and memory
Diagnosis
The most common test is the ‘Insulin tolerance test’. This involves giving an injection of insulin to the patient to lower the blood sugar level. During this stress reaction, the body normally releases growth hormone. Failure to produce an adequate amount of growth hormone in response to this insulin induced stress   confirms growth hormone deficiency. Alternative tests are also available in which growth hormone-releasing hormone, arginine or glucagon are used to cause growth hormone release. These tests should be carried out in a specialist unit, by experienced staff in performing these tests safely. 
Treatment
Adult growth hormone deficiency is treated with growth hormone replacement therapy. The growth hormone that is used is an artificial preparation that individuals can administer themselves. This is done using daily injections underneath the skin into the fat tissue around the lower abdomen, with an injection device. The needles are the same as those used by people who inject insulin for diabetes and the injections are virtually painless. Treatment starts as an outpatient clinic with education and support, usually from an endocrine nurse. Once started, individuals are carefully monitored and given regular blood tests. The dosage of the growth hormone is adjusted depending upon the patient’s response and results of blood tests.

Kidney Transplant Rejection Understanding
Kidney Transplant Rejection: Overview
Renal transplant rejection is an immunological response that leads to inflammation with specific pathological changes in the allograft, due to the recipient’s immune system recognizing the non-self (foreign) antigen in the allograft. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe chronic kidney disease as it improves the quality of life and has better survival advantages compared to dialysis. Depending on the histopathology and immunological characteristics, the renal transplant rejections can be classified broadly under the following categories:
1) Hyperacute rejection: Happens minutes after transplant, and it is related to the preformed antibody or ABO incompatibility; this is rarely seen now due to the very sensitive cross-match tests performed before the transplant.
2) Acute rejection: This can happen any time after transplant, usually within days to weeks after transplant. It classifies into the following:
A) Antibody-mediated rejection- ABMR: which usually demonstrates evidence of circulating donor-specific alloantibodies and immunological evidence of antibody-mediated injuries to the kidney. Like inflammation of glomeruli (Glomerulitis) or peritubular capillary (peritubular capillaritis).
B) Acute T-cell mediated rejection- TCMR: which characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the tubules, interstitium, and sometimes the arterial intima. 
3) Chronic rejection: It usually develops more than three months post-transplant. It can either be chronic antibody-mediated rejection or chronic T cells mediated rejection.   
4) A mixture of acute rejection superimposed on chronic rejection.
Diagnosis
Renal allograft biopsy is a direct and confirmative tool for the diagnosis of rejection that can be used to assess both the type and degree of rejection. 
Treatment
The treatment plan determination uses multiple factors, including the type of rejection, the severity of the histological lesion, the chronicity score, and the recipient comorbidity. 
1. Hyperacute rejection: No effective therapy usually leads to early allograft nephrectomy, and so prevention is the key by assuring through the following
i) ABO-compatibility between donor and recipient. Sometimes, it is advisable to address ABO incompatibility under specific criteria, and careful pre-transplant preparation of recipient with the removal of anti-ABO antibodies by plasmapheresis is an option, IVIG with or without rituximab
ii) Pre-transplant cross-match [complement cell cytotoxicity test]: Recipient serum is added to donor lymphocytes. If the test is positive (which means the recipient has an antibody that reacts with the donor HLA antigens on lymphocyte), one should not proceed with transplant unless these antibodies are removable pre-transplant.
2. Antibody-Mediated Rejection:
The treatment of acute antibody-mediated rejection also depends on the level of the antibody levels. Higher antibody levels need plasma exchange for the removal of the antibodies. The following are the different modalities used for AMR:
i) Plasma Exchange: 3 to 5 sessions daily on every other day is used for antibody removal followed by IVIG and rituximab
ii) IVIG: IV immunoglobulin (100 to 200 mg/kg) is used followed by the last session of plasma exchange when used in combination with plasmapheresis or higher dose 2g/kg after the final session of plasmapheresis.  
iii) Rituximab: Anti CD20 cell antibody rituximab (375 mg/m^2) is used in combination with IVIG followed by plasma exchange
iv) Bortezomib: Plasma cell inhibitor bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) is also used in combination with plasma exchange and IVIG
v) Splenectomy: Splenectomy is very rarely an option, but there are anecdotal reports of successful treatment of refractory rejections
vi) Optimize the dose and the level of the maintenance immunosuppressive drugs.
3. T Cell-Mediated rejection: They receive treatment with the following agents based on the severity of the lesion.
i) Methyl Prednisone IV (250 to 1000 mg daily) targeting T cells, B cells, and macrophages; given for 3 to 5 days
ii) rATG - Rabit anti-thymocyte globulin IV (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) targeting T cell receptors. The duration varies among different transplant centers, but in general, it is for 7 to 14 doses based on the response and Cd3 level.
iii) Optimize the dose and the level of the maintenance immunosuppressive drugs. 
4.  Chronic rejection: Since the antibody-mediated rejection mechanism is a major cause of chronic rejection, the same therapy as ABMR has been used, but generally, these measures are ineffective when Scr is over 3 mg/dl and/or heavy proteinuria.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Understanding
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Overview
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of disorders that arise from defective steroidogenesis. The production of cortisol in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex occurs in five major enzyme-mediated steps. CAH results from deficiency in any one of these enzymes. Impaired cortisol synthesis leads to chronic elevations of ACTH via the negative feedback system, causing overstimulation of the adrenal cortex and resulting in hyperplasia and oversecretion of the precursors to the enzymatic defect. In general, all forms of CAH are transmitted in autosomal recessive mode of inheritance as a monogenic disorder. The most common enzyme deficiency that accounts for more than 90% of all CAH cases is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 
Symptoms 
Many individuals with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia present with abnormally enlarged adrenal glands (hyperplastic adrenomegaly) that produce excessive amounts of androgens (male steroid hormones) leading to abnormal sexual development in females affected with the disease. Females with severe or classic virilizing CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency will most likely have ambiguous or atypical external genitalia (masculinization or virilization), although they are genetically female and will have normal internal reproductive organs. Males with this type of CAH will not have ambiguous genitalia. Both genders can experience other symptoms such as early onset of puberty, fast body growth, and premature completion of growth leading to short stature, if they are not diagnosed and treated in early life.
Diagnosis
Potential diagnosis of CAH must be suspected in infants born with ambiguous genitalia. The physician is obliged to make the diagnosis as quickly as possible to initiate therapy. The diagnosis and rational decision of sex assignment must rely on the determination of genetic sex, the hormonal determination of the specific deficient enzyme, and an assessment of the patient’s potential for future sexual activity and fertility. Diagnosis of the 21OHD CAH can also be confirmed biochemically by a hormonal evaluation. In a randomly timed blood sample, a very high concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), the precursor of the defective enzyme, is diagnostic of classical 21OHD. The gold standard for hormonal diagnosis is the corticotropin stimulation test (250 ?g cosyntropin intravenously), measuring levels of 17-OHP and ?4-androstenedione at baseline and 60 min.
Treatment
Treatment of classical CAH starts soon after birth and is needed throughout the patient’s life. People with classical CAH should have a team of healthcare providers, including specialists in pediatric endocrinology, uro-gynecologic surgery (for girls), psychology and genetics. People with classical CAH can have normal, fulfilling lives. The primary goal of treating classical CAH is to reduce the excess androgen production and replace the deficient hormones. Proper treatment with the correct dosage of these hormones is crucial to preventing adrenal crisis and virilization. Daily tablets including glucocorticoids (to replace cortisol), mineralocorticoids (to replace aldosterone) and salt supplements may be prescribed, particularly in infancy. Surgery may be considered to correct the appearance of ambiguous genitalia and/or relieve urethra-vaginal outlet obstruction that may lead to infection. Usually surgery is thought to be easier when performed at about 6-12 months after birth. Non-classical CAH on the other hand, is not life-threatening and relatively mild. People who have no obvious symptoms of non-classical CAH do not require surgery or medical treatment.

Desmoid Tumors Understanding
Desmoid Tumors: Overview
Desmoid tumors is an abnormal growth that arises from connective tissue. “Desmoid"" comes from the Greek word desmos, which means tendon or band-like. These are also known as aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-type fibromatosis. Desmoid tumors often appear as infiltrative, usually well-differentiated, firm overgrowths of fibrous tissue, and they are locally aggressive.  Desmoid tumors can occur in any part of body but most often occur in the abdomen, arms and legs. These are generally not considered cancerous (malignant) because they do not spread to other parts of the body (metastasize); however, they can aggressively invade the surrounding tissue and can be very difficult to remove surgically. Desmoid tumors occur frequently in people with an inherited form of colon cancer called familial adenomatous polyposis.
Symptoms 
The symptoms of Desmoid Tumors include:
• A mass or area of swelling
• Pain
• Loss of function in the affected area
• Pain and obstruction of the bowels
• Cramping and nausea, when desmoid tumors occur in the abdomen
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of Desmoid Tumors is based upon a thorough physical examination and specialized tests. Test like imaging tests, such as CT and MRI are done. Biopsy is done to make a definitive diagnosis. Antibodies are often examined in desmoid tumors, including smooth muscle actin, desmin and KIT, to aid in distinguishing them from other tumors.
Treatment
Some desmoid tumors are slow growing and don't require immediate treatment. Others that grow quickly are treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy including anticancer drugs, cryoablation or through combinatorial therapy. Anti-inflammatory drugs may cause the tumor to slowly shrink. Chemotherapy agents used to inhibit growth include Doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Rubex), Dacarabazine (DTIC-Dome) and Carboplatin (Paraplatin). Gleevec and Sorafenib are the two kinase inhibitors that are useful in treating desmoid tumors.
Desmoid Tumors Emerging Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Desmoid Tumors report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.
Desmoid Tumors Emerging Drugs
• Nirogacestat: SpringWorks Therapeutics
Nirogacestat is an oral, selective, small molecule, gamma secretase inhibitor. It is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for patients with desmoid tumors. The U.S. FDA has granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of desmoid tumors and Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis.
• Tegavivint: Iterion Therapeutics 
Tegavivint is a potent and selective inhibitor of nuclear ?-catenin that binds to TBL1 (Transducin ?eta-like Protein One). This enables specific silencing of Wnt-pathway oncogenic gene expression without affecting other necessary cellular functions and thus avoids toxicity issues common to other drugs in this pathway. Tegavivint is currently in Phase 2a clinical trial in progressive desmoid tumors after establishing safety and initial clinical efficacy in Phase 1 study.

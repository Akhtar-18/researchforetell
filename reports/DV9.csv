Brain PET-MRI Systems Overview
Benefits of offering high-resolution and 3-dimensional imaging of functional, biochemical, and molecular targets, positron emission tomography (PET) is largely used for neurological applications. The images recorded by PET technologies lacked spatial resolution, had poor sensitivity, inadequate attenuation, and required scattering correction, considering its benefit of covering and imaging the entire brain. PET devices are therefore paired with other imaging technologies, primarily magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to solve these problems for precise correspondence to the anatomical structures It is anticipated that clinical brain PET-MRI systems will see the highest development.

Indwelling Catheters Overview
An indwelling catheter (IUC), also known as a “Foley” catheter, is a closed system that is sterile and includes a catheter and a retention balloon. The catheter is inserted into the body either suprapubically or through the urethra to aid in bladder drainage via a drainage tube and a bag that collects the urine..  The market is witnessing a high demand for these products owing to the rising number of cases of urological diseases such as urinary tract infections, kidney stones as well as diabetes. Additionally, the growing popularity of minimally invasive procedures is also aiding in market growth.

Fiberscopes Overview
Fiberscope is a type of remote visual inspection device which is a compact fiber optic device with an ocular at one end and an optical lens at the other. For discovery of inaccessible places, fiberscopes are used. Fiberscopes are used to curve around corners or to go farther than a rigid scope would go before approaching the inspected area. Increased use of fiberscopes in minimally invasive procedures is expected to push the demand for fiberscopes. The market for fiberscopes is projected to rise in preference for minimally invasive surgeries. It is also predicted that innovations in hysteroscopes would fuel growth in the industry. The high cost of fibre optic networks, on the other hand, is expected to hamper the growth of the market.compact fiber optic device with an ocular at one end and an optical lens at the other.

Optogenetics Actuators and Sensors Overview
Optogenetics refers to the procedure that activates proteins optically that are used to regulate neuronal function. It is considered to be a new innovation in neuroscience that provides incurable disorders such as Parkinson's, retinal diseases and Alzheimer's disease treatment alternatives. This advanced technique is used to assist with neuron activity regulation and to understand functioning brain activity at the cellular level. The increase in the prevalence of retinal disease and neurological disorders among the population worldwide, widespread advancement and research in the field of optogenetics, and government funding programmes are the key factors driving the market. High costs associated with the procedure, on the other hand, are likely to hinder the market growth of optogenetic actuators and sensors. The introduction of ethical laws on animal protection is likely to challenge the demand for optogenetic actuators and sensors.

Intra Operative Imaging Overview
The intraoperative imaging method is a groundbreaking optical imaging technique that assists in surgical procedures is. Surgical operations are accelerated by intraoperative imaging devices via image guidance. A variety of factors are projected to drive the growth of the intraoperative imaging industry, such as the growth in the ageing population, the growing pressure of chronic diseases with evolving lifestyles, increasing preference and demand for minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), and expanding applications of neurosurgery and orthopedic surgery. However, it is anticipated that the high cost of intraoperative imaging equipment would have a negative effect on this market's expansion.

Carotid Artery Stent Overview
Carotid stenting is a procedure which open clogged arteries to restore blood flow to the brain. They're often performed to treat or prevent strokes. The carotid arteries are present on each side of the neck and are responsible for carrying blood to brain. These can get clogged with fatty deposits, decreasing or blocking the blood flow to the brain, and can lead to stroke. This condition is called carotid artery disease. Stenting involves placing a small metal coil known as stent in the clogged artery. The stent helps prop the artery open and decreases the chance of it narrowing again.

Adalimumab Understanding
Adalimumab: Overview
Adalimumab, sold under the brand name Humira among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It works by blocking a protein (tumor necrosis factor or TNF) found in the body's immune system that causes joint swelling and damage in arthritis as well as red scaly patches in psoriasis. Adalimumab belongs to a class of drugs known as TNF blockers. By reducing joint swelling, this medication helps to reduce further joint damage and preserve joint function. After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in levels of acute phase reactant proteins of inflammation (C­ reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was measured compared to baseline in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

Adalimumab Biosimilars: Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Adalimumab report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including marketed, phase III, II, I and preclinical. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Adalimumab Biosimilars: Marketed Drugs
• Abrilada: Pfizer
Abrilada is an FDA-approved biosimilar version of adalimumab. Abrilada (adalimumab-afzb) injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous administration. The drug product is supplied as either a single-dose prefilled pen (Abrilada pen), as a single-dose 1 mL prefilled glass syringe, or as a single-dose institutional use vial. Enclosed within the pen is a single-dose 1 mL prefilled glass syringe. Though approved, it is not yet marketed in the US like several other manufacturers of approved biosimilar versions of adalimumab, Pfizer has signed a licensing agreement with AbbVie; under the agreement, Samsung would be able to launch the drug in November 2023.

• Halimatoz: Sandoz
Halimatoz is mostly used in adults when their conditions are severe, moderately severe or getting worse, or when patients cannot use other treatments. Halimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab and is a ‘biosimilar medicine’. The active substance in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and attach to a substance in the body called tumour necrosis factor (TNF). TNF is involved in causing inflammation and is found at high levels in patients with the diseases that Halimatoz is used to treat. By attaching to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases.

Adalimumab Biosimilars: Emerging Drugs
• MYL-1401A: Mylan
MYL-1401A is an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. This tumour necrosis factor inhibitor is a proposed biosimilar of HUMIRA (adalimumab). MYL-1401A is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody and is being evaluated as an injectable therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis.

• CT-P17: Celltrion
CT-P17 is the first high-concentration type of medicine for a biosimilar made of adalimumab. The company has differentiated CT-P17 from existing Humira biosimilars by halving the dosage. By taking the latest trend into account, Celltrion has also removed citrate, which can cause pain in self-injection, from its latest product. If Celltrion launches CT-P17, it will be able to complete a robust portfolio of CT-P17 in the global autoimmune disorder treatment market. CT-P17 acts as immunosuppressants and tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors.

Pheochromocytoma Understanding
Pheochromocytoma: Overview
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that usually starts in the cells of one of your adrenal glands. It results in the release of too much epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. Pheochromocytoma may occur as a single tumor or as more than one growth. It usually develops in the center (medulla) of one or both adrenal glands. Symptoms associated with pheochromocytomas include high blood pressure (hypertension), headaches, excessive sweating, and/or heart palpitations. In approximately 25 to 35 percent of cases, pheochromocytomas may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Blood and urine analysis can confirm a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma by detecting elevated levels of catecholamines or its metabolites in the urine and blood (plasma). Phenoxybenzamine or a similar drug is generally given to stop hormone action. The most common surgical procedure for treating pheochromocytoma is laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Radiation therapy, in which radiation is used to target and destroy cancer cells, and certain combinations of anticancer drugs (chemotherapy) may also be used to treat individuals with malignant pheochromocytoma.

""Pheochromocytoma - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Pheochromocytoma pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Pheochromocytoma treatment guidelines.

It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Pheochromocytoma Emerging Drugs
• Sunitinib: Pfizer
Sunitinib is a novel oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antitumor and antiangiogenic activities. Sunitinib is approved in first-line treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) after disease progression or intolerance to imatinib mesylate therapy. The drug is in Phase II clinical studies for the treatment of Pheochromocytoma.

• Guadecitabine: Astex Pharmaceuticals
Guadecitabine is a next-generation DNA hypomethylating agent. Guadecitabine is rationally designed to be resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase, prolonging the exposure of tumor cells to the active metabolite, decitabine, thus ensuring greater uptake of decitabine into the DNA of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Guadecitabine-mediated inhibition of DNA methylation upregulates tumor-associated antigens and may sensitize tumor cells to other anticancer agents, including immunotherapeutics, as well as resensitize resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. The drug is in Phase II clinical evaluation for the treatment of Pheochromocytoma.

Meniere’s Disease Understanding
Meniere’s Disease: Overview
Meniere’s disease is a chronic condition that affects the inner ear. The disease is characterized by episodic vertigo attacks, fluctuating hearing loss that becomes permanent over time, tinnitus, and a feeling of ear fullness. The cause of Meniere's disease is unknown. Meniere’s disease usually affects only one ear. Attacks of dizziness may come on suddenly or after a short period of tinnitus or muffled hearing. Some people will have single attacks of dizziness separated by long periods of time. People with Meniere's can experience a feeling of pressure in the ear, sudden dizzy spells, tinnitus, muffled hearing or hearing loss. The symptoms of Meniere’s disease are caused by the buildup of fluid in the compartments of the inner ear, called the labyrinth. Although Meniere's disease can affect people of any age, people in their 40s and 50s are much more likely to experience it. A series of diagnostic tests can be done to check the balance and hearing. These include: Audiometric exam, electronystagmogram, electrocochleography, and auditory brainstem response test among others. No cure exists for Meniere's disease. A number of treatments can help reduce the severity and frequency of vertigo episodes. 
""Meniere’s Disease - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Scleroderma Understanding
Scleroderma: Overview
Scleroderma is a group of rare diseases that involve the hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues. Scleroderma affects women more often than men and most commonly occurs between the ages of 30 and 50. While there is no cure for scleroderma, a variety of treatments can ease symptoms and improve quality of life. There are many different types of scleroderma. In some people, scleroderma affects only the skin. But in many people, scleroderma also harms structures beyond the skin, such as blood vessels, internal organs and the digestive tract (systemic scleroderma). Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. There are 2 main types of scleroderma: localised scleroderma – just affects the skin and systemic sclerosis – may affect blood circulation and internal organs as well as the skin.

Cystinuria Understanding
Cystinuria: Overview
Cystinuria is a rare genetic disorder that causes a buildup of an amino acid called cystine in the urine. This can result in the formation of cystine kidney stones. Cystine stones are often larger, harder and form more frequently than other kinds of kidney stones. Due to the larger stone size, cystine stones may be more difficult to pass, often requiring surgical procedures to remove. Stones can create blockages in the urinary tract and reduce the ability of the kidneys to eliminate waste through urine. The stones also provide sites where bacteria may cause infections. Signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the presence of stones and may include blood in the urine, flank pain, and frequent urinary tract infections.

""Cystinuria - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Lupus Nephritis Understanding
Lupus Nephritis: Overview
Lupus nephritis is glomerulonephritis caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Clinical findings include hematuria, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and, in advanced stages, azotemia. Diagnosis is based on renal biopsy. Treatment is of the underlying disorder and usually involves corticosteroids and cytotoxic or other immunosuppressant drugs. Lupus nephritis is diagnosed in about 50% of patients with SLE and typically develops within 1 year of diagnosis. However, the total incidence is probably > 90%, because renal biopsy in patients with suspected SLE without clinical evidence of renal disease shows changes of glomerulonephritis (GN).

""Lupus Nephritis - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Lupus Nephritis pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Lupus Nephritis treatment guidelines. The assessment part of the report embraces, in depth Lupus Nephritis commercial assessment and clinical assessment of the pipeline products under development. In the report, detailed description of the drug is given which includes mechanism of action of the drug, clinical studies, NDA approvals (if any), and product development activities comprising the technology, Lupus Nephritis collaborations, licensing, mergers and acquisition, funding, designations and other product related details.

Report Highlights

Lupus Nephritis Emerging Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Lupus Nephritis report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including phase II, I, preclinical and Discovery. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Lupus Nephritis Emerging Drugs
• Obinutuzumab: Roche
Obinutuzumab (RG7159, GA101) is the first glycoengineered, type II, humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It has a distinct mode of action compared with other anti-CD20s, including MabThera/Rituxan, and was specifically designed to selectively target the CD20 protein on B cells and to bind with high affinity to the cell surface in a type II configuration. The drug is in phase 3 of clinical trials for the treatment of Lupus Nephritis.

• Narsoplimab: Omeros Corporation
Narsoplimab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2), the effector enzyme of the lectin pathway of the complement system. The lectin pathway is one of the principal pathways of complement and is activated primarily by tissue damage and microbial infection. Importantly, inhibition of MASP-2 does not appear to interfere with the classical complement pathway, a critical component of the acquired immune response to infection. This novel, proprietary drug is designed to prevent complement-mediated inflammation and endothelial damage while leaving intact the respective functions of the other pathways of innate immunity. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Lupus Nephritis.

Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Understanding
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: Overview
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease predominantly affecting middle-aged women. It is hypothesized that PBC begins with loss of immune self tolerance, leading to damage of the biliary epithelial cells of small bile ducts. Ongoing immunologic events perpetuate the biliary epithelial cell destruction via direct cytotoxicity or lymphokine-mediated cell damage, leading to disease progression. PBC is most commonly diagnosed after the age of 40 years. Of patients with PBC, 90% are women

Endometrial Cancer Understanding
Endometrial Cancer: Overview
Endometrial cancer is cancer of the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. It is the most common type of cancer that affects the female reproductive organs. The most common type of endometrial cancer (type 1) grows slowly. It most often is found only inside the uterus. Type 2 is less common. It grows more rapidly and tends to spread to other parts of the body. Endometrial cancer occurs when the cells of the endometrium start to grow too rapidly. The lining of the uterus may thicken in certain places. These areas of thickness may form a mass of tissue called a tumor. Cancer cells also can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.

Anal Cancer Understanding
Anal Cancer: Overview
Anal cancer is a rare condition, although its incidence has been increasing over the past several decades, particularly in women. The majority of anal cancers are squamous cell cancers and are linked with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Many anal cancers are found early because they are in a location that your physician can easily see and reach. Diagnosis is often made when people with any of the above symptoms undergo an anal exam. Anal cancer may also be found incidentally during yearly physical exams that include a digital rectal exam. The rectal exam is performed to check the rectum, prostate or other pelvic organs. Anal cancers can also be found when a person has a preventive colorectal screening test (such as a colonoscopy).

Anal Cancer Emerging Drugs
• Atezolizumab: Genentech
Atezolizumab blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and CD80 receptors (B7-1Rs).[16] PD-L1 can be highly expressed on certain tumors, which is thought to lead to reduced activation of immune cells (cytotoxic T-cells in particular) that might otherwise recognize and attack the cancer.[16] Inhibition of PD-L1 by atezolizumab can remove this inhibitor effect and thereby engender an anti-tumor response. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of anal cancer,

• Avelumab: Merck KGaA
Avelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Avelumab has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, avelumab has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models. The drug is in phase I/II of clinical trials for the treatment of anal cancer.

Adrenocortical Carcinoma Understanding
Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Overview
Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease. It is caused by a cancerous growth in the adrenal cortex, which is the outer layer of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands lie on top of the kidneys. They play an important role in the endocrine system, which is the system that produces and regulates hormones. ACC is also known as adrenocortical carcinoma. The adrenal cortex makes hormones that regulate metabolism and blood pressure. It also produces cortisol and the male hormones called androgens, such as testosterone. ACC may trigger excessive production of these hormones.

""Adrenocortical Carcinoma - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Adrenocortical Carcinoma pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Adrenocortical Carcinoma treatment guidelines.

Adrenocortical Carcinoma Emerging Drugs
• Relacorilant: Corcept Therapeutics
Relacorilant is a non-steroidal, selective modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor, the receptor for cortisol which is activated when cortisol levels are high. Relacorilant does not bind to the body's other hormone receptors. Corcept is studying relacorilant as a potential treatment for a variety of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome and advanced adrenal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. 

• Ipilimumab: Bristol-Myers Squibb
Yervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. The drug is in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of Adrenocortical carcinoma.

Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) Understanding
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS): Overview
Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome or syndromes (CAPS), also known as cryopyrinopathies, are genetic autoinflammatory syndromes defined by ‘gain-of-function’ mutations affecting the cryopyrin protein. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes are all autosomal dominant genetic conditions, meaning only one copy of the abnormal gene is required to develop the clinical syndrome. CAPS comprises 3 disorders on a continuum of severity: severe CINCA syndrome, intermediate Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and milder familial cold urticaria (FCAS).

CAR-T Understanding
CAR-T: Overview
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a kind of cancer treatment that uses specially aletered T-cells- a part of the immune system. It seeks to sharpen and strengthen the immune system’s power to fight the cancer cells. the A sample of a patient's T cells are collected from the blood, then modified to produce special structures called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. When these CAR T cells are reinfused into the patient, the new receptors enable them to latch onto a specific antigen on the patient's tumor cells and kill them.

Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia Understanding
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia: Overview
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells. In this the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells that crowd out the normal healthy blood cells. Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia is considered a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's is also sometimes called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.  Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia is slow growing and may not cause signs and symptoms for many years. When they occur the symptoms may include: easy bruising, fatigue, weight loss, fever, numbness in hands and feet’s, change in vision and shortness of breath. What causes Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia is still not clear. The disease generally begins with one abnormal white blood cell that develops errors (mutations) in its genetic code. The treatment options may include: chemotherapy, Plasma exchange, Targeted Therapy, Biological therapy and Bone marrow transplant.

Wilson ’s disease Understanding
Wilson ’s disease: Overview
Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excess copper stored in various body tissues, particularly the liver, brain, and corneas of the eyes. The disease is progressive and, if left untreated, it may cause liver (hepatic) disease, central nervous system dysfunction, and death. Common signs of associated liver disease include a yellow discoloration (jaundice) of the skin, mucous membranes and the membranes (sclera) that line the eye, swelling (edema) of the legs and abdomen (ascites). Wilson disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Wilson disease is caused by disruption or changes (mutations) of the ATP7B gene, which plays an important role in the movement of excess copper from the liver to the bile to eventually be excreted from the body through the intestines. Treatment for Wilson disease is life-long and aimed at lowering copper levels to nontoxic levels, and at preventing the progression of the disease and trying to reverse any signs and symptoms that have appeared because of copper accumulation in the body.

Intraocular (Uveal) melanoma Understanding
Intraocular (Uveal) melanoma: Overview
Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Intraocular is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissues of the eye. Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris. While development of uveal melanoma is largely considered to be a sporadic event, certain risk factors including light iris color, light skin color, ability to tan and others predispose individuals to Uveal melanoma. Tests that examine the eye are: Ophthalmoscopy, Slip-lamp examination, Gonioscopy and others have been used to help diagnose intraocular melanoma.

Acute Liver Failure Understanding
Acute Liver Failure: Overview
Acute liver failure is an uncommon condition in which rapid deterioration of liver function results in coagulopathy. Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that occurs rapidly — in days or weeks. Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including excessive bleeding and increasing pressure in the brain. Signs and Symptoms of Acute liver failure include: pain in right abdomen, yellowing of skin, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness and disorientation of confusion. Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute liver failure include: blood tests and imaging tests for the examination of liver.

Primary Open Angle Glaucoma Understanding
Primary Open Angle Glaucoma: Overview
Primary open-angle glaucoma is a syndrome of optic nerve damage associated with an open anterior chamber angle and an elevated or sometimes average intraocular pressure (IOP). The most common symptom is the visual field loss. Diagnosis of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma is usually done by ophthalmoscopy, gonioscopy, visual field examination, and measurement of central corneal thickness and IOP. Treatment options includes topical drugs and often requires laser or incisional surgery to increase aqueous drainage.

Vasculitis Understanding
Vasculitis: Overview
Vasculitis involves inflammation of the blood vessels. The inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken, which reduces the width of the passageway through the vessel. If blood flow is restricted, it can result in organ and tissue damage. Vasculitis can affect people at any age. Some forms affect blood vessels that go to or supply specific organs like your skin, eyes, or brain. Vasculitis can have general symptoms like fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Treatment depends on what’s causing your vasculitis and which organs are affected. Corticosteroid medications, also known as steroids, are generaaly preferred to fight inflammation.

It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.
Vasculitis Emerging Drugs
?   CCX-168: ChemoCentryx, Inc.
CCX-168 (Avacopan) is an orally-administered drug candidate that inhibits the complement C5a receptor, or C5aR, and is being developed for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Avacopan blocks the activity of complement C5a, a component of the complement system and the natural ligand for C5aR. The phase III clinical trials for CCX-168 are being conducted for the treatment of ANCA-associated Vasculitis. The FDA has granted CCX-168 orphan-drug designation for ANCA-associated vasculitis and C3G.

? Belimumab: GlaxoSmithKline
Belimumab selectively binds to soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS) so that BLyS is unable to bind to receptors on B lymphocytes. The binding of BLyS to its receptor is essential for the survival of B lymphocytes. Consequently, belimumab reduces B-cell mediated immunity and the autoimmune response. It is being studied in phase III stage of development for the treatment of Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated Vasculitis.

Medical Vacuum Regulator Overview
A vacuum regulator is a mechanism used to control and maintain a vacuum system’s desired vacuum pressure. The function of the regulator is to keep the vacuum of the draining system at a preset level by responding to fluctuating air admissions into the system. A vacuum regulator controls pressure with inlet and outlet ports that let higher pressure air into or out of a system as needed. The regulator’s outgoing airflow has a lower pressure than the air being drawn into the vacuum pump. When the process vacuum’s pressure setting is reached, the vacuum regulator closes, blocking the extra flow of the vacuum supply line. If the pressure in the system is higher than desired, the valve opens, allowing airflow out. There are various kinds of vacuum regulators. The mechanical vacuum regulator works on the principle of balanced force.

Transcranial Doppler Overview
Transcranial Doppler (TCD), first described in 1982, is a noninvasive ultrasound (US) study that involves the use of a low-frequency (?2?MHz) transducer probe to insonate the basal cerebral arteries through relatively thin bone windows. TCD allows dynamic monitoring of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF-V) and vessel pulsatility over extended time periods with a high temporal resolution. It is relatively inexpensive, repeatable, and its portability offers increased convenience over other imaging methods.

Oncolytic Virus Cancer Therapy Understanding
Oncolytic Virus Cancer Therapy: Overview
Oncolytic virus (OV) cancer therapies are the virus based therapeutic strategies that infect and destroy cancer cells, and therefore act as an in situ cancer vaccine by releasing tumor-specific antigens. Viruses such as myxoma virus or reovirus have inherent selectivity to tumor cells, while being nonpathogenic to healthy human cells. On the other hand, other OVs, including adenovirus, herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), have been genetically engineered to function as vectors to boost anti-tumor immune responses. The therapeutic efficacy of Oncolytic viruses depends on two main modes of action: First, Oncolytic viruses can inhibit protein synthesis of tumor cells and destroy infected tumor cells by self-replication. After viral infection, Oncolytic viruses continue self-replication until the cell bursts; Second, Oncolytic viruses can recruit and activate tumor-infiltrating immune cells by releasing a large amount of tumor antigens and secreting cytokines. Oncolytic virus cancer therapies can be used for diagnosis as well treatment of cancer. The anti-tumor efficacies of these OVs have been evaluated in many preclinical and clinical studies as monotherapy and combination therapy.

NMDA receptor antagonists Understanding
NMDA receptor antagonists: Overview
The NMDA receptor is an ionotropic receptor that allows for the transfer of electrical signals between neurons in the brain and in the spinal column. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor is a ligand of glutamate, which is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. The activation of NMDA receptors has been associated with hyperalgesia, neuropathic pain, and reduced functionality of opioid receptors. Molecules that block the NMDA receptor are called NMDA-receptor antagonists. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are also expressed across a wide spectrum of non-neuronal cells, including central and peripheral glial cells, endothelium, bone, kidney, pancreas, and others. NMDA-receptor antagonists can be used in the management of chronic pain and Alzheimer's disease. Commercially available NMDA-receptor antagonists include ketamine, dextromethorphan, memantine, and amantadine. The opioids methadone, dextropropoxyphene, and ketobemidone are also antagonists at the NMDA receptor.

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence NMDA receptor antagonists R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches for NMDA receptor antagonists.

MTORC1 protein inhibitors Understanding
 Overview
mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase in the PI3K-related kinase (PIKK) family that forms the catalytic subunit of two distinct protein complexes, known as mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is defined by its three core components: mTOR, Raptor (regulatory protein associated with mTOR), and mLST8 (mammalian lethal with Sec13 protein 8, also known as G?L).

Function - In order to grow and divide, cells must increase production of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides while also suppressing catabolic pathways such as autophagy. mTORC1 plays a central role in regulating all of these processes, and therefore controls the balance between anabolism and catabolism in response to environmental conditions. mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis largely through the phosphorylation of two key effectors, p70S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) and eIF4E Binding Protein (4EBP). mTORC1 directly phosphorylates S6K1 on its hydrophobic motif site, Thr389, enabling its subsequent phosphorylation and activation by PDK1.

MTORC1 protein inhibitors - New mTOR-specific inhibitors came forth from screening and drug discovery efforts. These compounds block activity of both mTOR complexes and are called mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors. Compounds with this characteristics such as sapanisertib have entered clinical trials. A series of these mTOR kinase inhibitors have been studied. Their structure is derived from morpholino pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold. Improvements of this type of inhibitors have been made by exchanging the morpholines with bridged morpholines in pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitors and results showed increased selectivity to mTOR by 26000 fold.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors Understanding
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors: Overview
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA through its two catalytic activities, biotin carboxylase (BC) and carboxyltransferase (CT). ACC is a multi-subunit enzyme in most prokaryotes and in the chloroplasts of most plants and algae, whereas it is a large, multi-domain enzyme in the cytoplasm of most eukaryotes. The most important function of ACC is to provide the malonyl-CoA substrate for the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

Function - Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Hydrolysis of ATP provides the energy to drive this essentially irreversible reaction. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is considered the key regulatory enzyme in the conversion of citrate to long-chain fatty acids because (i) the concentrations of its substrates and products are far from thermodynamic equilibrium; (ii) the maximum velocity of the enzyme, as measured in cell extracts under optimal conditions, is usually the slowest of all enzymes in the pathway; (iii) the concentration of the product of the enzyme, malonyl-CoA, increases when flux through the pathway increases.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors - With the accumulation of information on the ACC functions and structures in the last decade, a variety of ACC inhibitors have been identified, some of which have been approved for clinical trials.

Anti-CD38 antibody Understanding
Anti-CD38 antibody: Overview
CD38 is a small multifunctional glycoprotein (1) widely represented on lymphoid and myeloid lineages but absent from most mature resting lymphocytes. In many lymphoid tumors—including most cases of myeloma (2), many cases of AIDS-associated lymphoma (3), and many cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferations (4)—it is present on the cell surface in amounts which render it an attractive target for therapeutic antibody.

Function - CD38 is also known to have important enzymatic functions, acting as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) degrading enzyme (NADase) in several tissues. Specifically, it breaks down NAD into nicotinamide and adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) or, to a lesser extent, cyclic ADPR (cADPR). In this manner, CD38 regulates the homeostasis of NAD, a crucial cofactor in cell signaling and metabolism, while controlling the availability of its metabolites. ADPR acts as a second messenger in calcium signaling and can be further metabolized into the nucleoside adenosine.

Anti-CD38 antibody - During the past  years, therapies targeting CD38, a protein highly expressed on the surface of plasma cells, have helped fuel the rapidly growing treatment options for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Investigators are seeking to build on that success by expanding uses for existing drugs and exploring novel strategies aimed at CD38 activity in MM.

Anti-CD38 antibody Emerging Drugs
• Felzartamab (MOR202): MorphoSys
Felzartamab (MOR202) is a therapeutic human monoclonal antibody derived from MorphoSys’ HuCAL antibody library and directed against CD38. Felzartamab is currently under clinical investigation in patients with anti-PLA2R antibody-positive membranous nephropathy, a kidney specific autoimmune disease, and in patients with multiple myeloma. The drug is currently in phase 3 of clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

• STI-6129: Sorrento Therapeutics
STI-6129 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a fully human monoclonal anti-CD38 antibody covalently bound by a proprietary chemical linker to a duostatin tubulin inhibitor. STI-6129 has demonstrated an improved therapeutic index in animal models, as compared to traditional non-selective conjugates. STI-6129 has the potential for being a first-line treatment for amyloidosis as well as second line in those patients who have developed daratumumab resistance, an anti-CD38 mAb alone. STI-6129 binds to different epitopes than daratumumab and the addition of the targeted delivery of the duostatin can potentially manage those patients who have become refractory to such treatments.

Sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor modulators Understanding
Sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor modulators: Overview
Sphingolipids represent an essential class of lipids found in all eukaryotes, and strongly influence cellular signal transduction. Autoimmune diseases like asthma and multiple sclerosis (MS) are mediated by the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) to express a variety of symptoms and disease patterns. Inspired by its natural substrate, an array of artificial sphingolipid derivatives has been developed to target this specific G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) in an attempt to suppress autoimmune disorders.

Function - Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P receptor 1 or S1P1) is a G-protein coupled receptor. Signaling leads to the activation of RAC1, SRC, PTK2/FAK1 and MAP kinases. It plays an important role in cell migration, migration of osteoclast precursor cells, the regulation of bone mineralization and bone homeostasis and in the protection against ventilator-induced lung injury. It is required for normal chemotaxis toward sphingosine 1-phosphate, normal embryonic heart development and normal cardiac morphogenesis. It inhibits sprouting angiogenesis to prevent excessive sprouting during blood vessel development.

Sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor modulators - Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators possess a unique mechanism of action as disease modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS). Subtype 1 S1P receptors are expressed on the surfaces of lymphocytes and are important in regulating egression from lymph nodes. The S1P receptor modulators indirectly antagonize the receptor’s function and sequester lymphocytes in lymph nodes.

Selective estrogen receptor degraders: Overview
Estrogen receptor (ER) plays important roles in gene transcription and the proliferation of ER positive breast cancers. Selective modulation of ER has been a therapeutic target for this specific type of breast cancer. 

Function - Estrogens, a class of steroid hormones, regulate the growth, development, and physiology of the human reproductive system. Estrogens also involve in the neuroendocrine, skeletal, adipogenesis, and cardiovascular systems. Estrogen signaling pathways are selectively stimulated or inhibited depending on a balance between the activities of estrogen receptor (ER) ? or ER? in target organs. ERs belong to the steroid hormone superfamily of nuclear receptors, which act as transcription factors after binding to estrogen. The gene expression regulation by ERs is to modulate biological activities, such as reproductive organ development, bone modeling, cardiovascular system functioning, metabolism, and behavior in both females and males.

Selective estrogen receptor degraders- A selective estrogen receptor degrader or downregulator (SERD) is a type of drug which binds to the estrogen receptor (ER) and, in the process of doing so, causes the ER to be degraded and thus downregulated. They are used to treat estrogen receptor-sensitive or progesterone receptor-sensitive breast cancer, along with older classes of drugs like selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors.

Amyloid beta-protein inhibitors Understanding
Amyloid beta-protein inhibitors: Overview
Amyloid-? (A?) denotes peptides of 36–43 amino acids that are crucially involved in Alzheimer's disease as the main component of theamyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer patients. The peptides result from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is being cut by certain enzymes to yield A?. Amyloid-? molecules can aggregate to form flexible soluble oligomers which may exist in several forms. Amyloid-? peptide is due to overproduction of A? and/or the failure of clearance mechanisms. Amyloid-? self-aggregates into oligomers, which can be of various sizes, and forms diffuse and neuritic plaques in the parenchyma and blood vessels.

Function – The progressive production and subsequent accumulation of ?-amyloid (A?), a proteolytic fragment of the membrane-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP), plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A? is released in a soluble form that may be responsible for cognitive dysfunction in the early stages of the disease, then progressively forms oligomeric, multimeric and fibrillar aggregates, triggering neurodegeneration. Eventually, the aggregation and accumulation of A? culminates with the formation of extracellular plaques, one of the morphological hallmarks of the disease, detectable post-mortem in AD brains.

Amyloid beta-protein inhibitors- Inhibition of the formation of these toxic polymers of A? has thus emerged as an approach to developing therapeutics for AD. Therefore, blocking the initial stages of A? peptide aggregation with small molecules could hold considerable promise as the starting point for the development of new therapies for AD.

• Aducanumab: Biogen
Biogen’s aducanumab — a monoclonal antibody is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If ultimately approved, it is predicted that the drug, which only showed modest efficacy in phase III clinical trial, could become the best-selling drug of all time.

• Crenezumab: Hoffman-La-Roche
Crenezumab (RG7412) is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to amyloid beta (Abeta). Abeta is the main constituent of amyloid plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and is proposed to be causative in the development of the disease. A phase II clinical trial is evaluating Crenezumab in healthy individuals with a history of familial Alzheimer’s disease. Roche plans to submit regulatory applications for marketing Crenezumab for Alzheimer's disease by 2023.

Protein 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitors Understanding
Protein 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitors: Overview
50S, roughly equivalent to the 60S ribosomal subunit in eukaryotic cells, is the larger subunit of the 70S ribosome of prokaryotes. The 50S subunit is primarily composed of proteins but also contains single-stranded RNA known as ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The bacterial ribosome is one of the main targets of antibiotics, with most clinically used antibiotics targeting peptidyl-transferase centre on the large subunit (50S subunit).

Function – 50S includes the activity that catalyzes peptide bond formation (peptidyl transfer reaction), prevents premature polypeptide hydrolysis, provides a binding site for the G-protein factors (assists initiation, elongation, and termination), and helps protein folding after synthesis. 

Protein 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitors- The translational functions of the bacterial ribosome are the target for a large number of antimicrobial agents. There is a diverse range of clinically important antibiotics that interfere with protein synthesis by binding at various functional centers of the ribosome and either freezing a particular conformation of the ribosome or hindering the binding of its ligands.

Interleukin 13 inhibitors Understanding
Interleukin 13 inhibitors: Overview
IL-13 is an important cytokine in chronic airways inflammation. IL-13 is involved in Th2 inflammation and has been identified as a possible therapeutic target in the treatment of asthma and allergies. IL-13 gene encodes an immunoregulatory cytokine produced primarily by activated Th2 cells. This cytokine is involved in several stages of B-cell maturation and differentiation. It up-regulates CD23 and MHC class II expression, and promotes IgE isotype switching of B cells. This cytokine down-regulates macrophage activity, thereby inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Function – IL-13 is a 132-amino-acid nonglycosylated cytokine that shares common features with IL-4. IL-13 inhibits TNF, IL-1, IL-8, and MIP-1a production, NF-kB activation and CD14 and Fcg receptor expression. It induces cell surface expression of b2 integrins and MHC class II antigens. IL-13 appears to play a profibrotic role in the aging heart. Interleukin (IL)-13 is a cytokine that also represents a potential critical factor in the development and persistence of asthma.

Interleukin 13 inhibitors- As interleukin (IL)-13 play a major role in various diseases including asthma, allergy, and malignancies, it is desirable to generate a molecule that blocks this cytokine. IL-13 inhibitor inhibits IL-4 binding to these cells and prevents heterodimer formation between IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-4Ralpha chains. This interference by IL-13 inhibitor blocks the biological activities of not only IL-13 but also partially of IL-4. Thus, IL-13 inhibitor may be a useful agent for the treatment of diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cancer, which are dependent on signaling through both IL-4 and IL-13 receptors.

 Opioid kappa receptor agonists Understanding
 Opioid kappa receptor agonists: Overview
Opioids have been used for thousands of years for the treatment of pain. Opioid analgesics can act through three different types of opioid receptors, called mu, delta, and kappa. To prevent undesirable CNS and opioid receptor mediated side effects, there has been an effort to develop opioids which activate peripheral kappa opioid receptors present on sensory nerves, immune cells and the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Such compounds, Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonists (KORAs), are thought to have the potential to provide pain relief (peripheral opioid analgesia) without producing significant CNS and mu-opioid mediated side effects.

Function – Both classical opioid receptors (MOP/ KOP/DOP) and the non-classical NOP opioid receptor couple to inhibitory G-proteins. Activation of opioid receptors, for example MOP with morphine leads to: (i) closing of voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCC); (ii) stimulation of potassium efflux leading to hyperpolarization; and (iii) reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Overall, this results in reduced neuronal cell excitability leading to a reduction in transmission of nerve impulses along with inhibition of neurotransmitter release. 

 Opioid kappa receptor agonists- Kappa opioid receptor (KOPr) agonists have recently received increased attention due to their analgesic effects and lack of abuse potential. There are several strategies currently used to develop safer and more effective KOPr agonists. These strategies include identifying G-protein biased agonists; developing peripherally-restricted KOPr agonists without centrally-mediated side-effects; and developing mixed opioid agonists, which target multiple receptors at specific ratios to balance side-effect profiles and reduce tolerance.

 Opioid kappa receptor agonists Emerging Drugs
• Nalfurafine hydrochloride: Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical
Nalfurafine hydrochloride (TRK-820 hydrochloride) is a potent selective and orally active G protein-biased kappa opioid receptor (KOR)-agonist with high translational potential. Nalfurafine hydrochloride (TRK-820 hydrochloride) enhances the therapeutic potential of MOR-targeting analgesics, has the potential for uremic pruritis treatment. Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical has initiated a phase III clinical trial for the treatment of Uremic Pruritus. 

• Asimadoline: Tioga Pharmaceuticals
Asimadoline is an orally active, highly selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist with approximately 500-fold greater affinity for human kappa-, as compared with either delta- or mu-opioid receptors. Due to its high selectivity for the kappa-opioid receptor, asimadoline does not produce mu-opioid like side-effects. Due to its mechanism of action, asimadoline has the potential to treat pruritus associated with a variety of conditions, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, end-stage renal disease, liver diseases such as cholestatic disease and primary biliary cirrhosis, malignancies, adverse drug effects, and certain orphan diseases. The drug is currently in Phase II stage of development for the treatment of pruitis.

Serotonin 3 receptor antagonists Understanding
Serotonin 3 receptor antagonists: Overview
Serotonin receptor (5-HT3AR) is the most common therapeutic target to manage the nausea and vomiting during cancer therapies and in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Setrons, a class of competitive antagonists, cause functional inhibition of 5-HT3AR in the gastrointestinal tract and brainstem, acting as effective anti-emetic agents. 

Function – The 5-HT3 receptors, like nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), GABAA/C, and glycine receptors, are members of the Cys-loop family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. They play important roles in fast neurotransmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 5-HT3 receptors are located primarily in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where they have roles in regulating gut motility and the emesis reflex.

Serotonin 3 receptor antagonists- Serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are commonly used to decrease nausea and vomiting for surgery patients. Selective serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonists block serotonin both peripherally, on gastrointestinal (GI) vagal nerve terminals, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This blockade results in powerful antiemetic effects.

Ghrelin receptor agonists Understanding
Ghrelin receptor agonists: Overview
Ghrelin is a hormone produced by specific cells in the stomach. It exerts its action by binding to receptors in the hypothalamus involved in the regulation of food intake. Ghrelin causes an increase in the pituitary secretion of growth hormone (GH). Drugs that bind and activate the ghrelin receptor have been explored for their effect on appetite, weight gain, frailty, cachexia, inflammation and gut motility. Ghrelin exerts its effects through a specific G?protein?coupled receptor called the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS?R1a). Another GHS?R cDNA is produced by alternative splicing which produces a COOH?terminal truncated form (GHS?R1b) that is pharmacologically inactive. The GHS?R1a is expressed in several areas of the hypothalamus associated with feeding behaviour, including the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei. GHS?R1a is also found in the pituitary gland, and other organs such as bone, heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas and immune cells.

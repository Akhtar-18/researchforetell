Lubricants are used to reduce the friction between two moving parts by introducing a film to avoid direct contact of the moving parts and reduce the frictional losses with increase in life of the components. Although due to contact of the moving parts especially at high speeds, the temperature increases which increases the temperature of the lubricant which is introduced between them and causes thinning of the lubricant which might lead to vaporization or diminished properties of the lubricant. To ensure the lubricant remains effective even at higher temperatures, different additives including Viscosity Index Improvers are added that improve the consistency and effectiveness of the lubricants at various temperatures. Lubricants are widely used in automobile and industrial applications. The quality of lubricant defines the life of a component of machinery used in the industries. Due to high capital investments that the companies make in these machineries that operate continuously, it becomes necessary to undertake preventive measures, corrective maintenance and breakdown maintenance. Lubricants are used to reduce wear and tear and hence increase the life of machines. Due to this there is a rise in the demand of lubricants which in turn drives the demand for VI improvers market. Automobiles employ brake fluids, transmission lubricants, engine lubricants etc. and require timely top-ups in order to ensure smooth functioning and life of the automobile. Due to this, there is a rise in the demand of high quality lubricants that perform at varying temperatures which complements the demand for VI improvers and drives the growth of the market.

Water-based ink is considered to be an excellent ink system for high speed roll-to-roll yardage printing which is done on large and complex equipment with high drying capacities. It is also a preferred choice in case or applications where penetration is desirable as in case of towel printing. Hence water-based inks are highly preferred for such applications in fabric treatment. Water-based ink contains very less Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) which are emitted from other types of inks that have an adverse effect on environment. Governments are putting a cap on the amount of VOC emitted by the industries and hence it becomes important for them to switch to non-VOC alternatives to comply with the guidelines.

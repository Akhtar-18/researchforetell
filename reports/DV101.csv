Acinetobacter infections Understanding
Acinetobacter infections: Overview
Acinetobacter are gram-negative aerobic bacilli or coccobacilli that belong to the family Moraxellaceae. They are ubiquitous and can survive on dry surfaces for up to a month and are commonly carried on the skin of health care workers, increasing the likelihood of patients being colonized and medical equipment being contaminated. There are many species of Acinetobacter; all can cause human disease, but Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) accounts for about 80% of infections. Acinetobacter easily colonize tracheostomy sites and can cause community-acquired bronchiolitis and tracheobronchitis in healthy children and tracheobronchitis in immunocompromised adults. Hospital-acquired Acinetobacter pneumonias are frequently multilobar and complicated. Secondary bacteremia and septic shock are associated with a poor prognosis.

Acinetobacter infections Emerging Drugs
• Sulbactam-durlobactam: Entasis Therapeutics
Durlobactam (DUR; previously designated ETX2514) is a novel, broad-spectrum and potent inhibitor of Class A, C, and D ?-lactamases. Sulbactam (SUL) is a ?-lactam antibiotic with activity against Acinetobacter baumannii; however, ?-lactamase-mediated resistance to sulbactam is now widespread rendering it generally ineffective. In preclinical studies, durlobactam inhibits the ?-lactamases commonly found in A. baumannii thus restoring sulbactam’s activity. The company is developing SUL-DUR (previously designated ETX2514SUL), a combination of ?-lactam antibiotic and a ?-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of serious infections cuased by Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. The drug is currently in phase III of clinical trials for the treatment of Acinetobacter infections.

Aspergillosis Understanding
Aspergillosis: Overview
Aspergillosis is an infection caused by Aspergillus, a common mold (a type of fungus) that lives indoors and outdoors. Aspergillus spores present in the environment can be taken inside the body while breathing which leads to aspergillosis. However, people with weakened immune systems or lung diseases are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to Aspergillus. Types of Aspergillosis are Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), Allergic Aspergillus sinusitis, Azole-Resistant Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergilloma, Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, Invasive aspergillosis, and Cutaneous (skin) aspergillosis. Diagnosis of Aspergillosis is done by examining the patient history and various tests including blood tests to check for antibodies, allergens, and fungus molecules; X-ray; CT scan, and/or sputum stain and culture to examine the bronchial mucus. Treatment options for Aspergillosis include oral corticosteroids, antifungal medications, and surgery.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis Understanding
Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Overview
Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated/allergen-mediated clinicopathological condition. It is characterised clinically by symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction (e.g., dysphagia and food impaction in adolescents and adults, and vomiting, regurgitation, heartburn, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, or feeding intolerance in children), and histologically by an eosinophilic infiltration of the oesophageal epithelium of ?15 eosinophils per high-power microscopy field in the absence of other causes of local or systemic eosinophilia. Normally there are no eosinophils in the esophagus. A person with EoE will have inflammation and increased numbers of eosinophils in the esophagus. The chronic inflammation of EoE leads to symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of EoE is important to prevent progression to fibrotic changes in the esophagus which may be only partially reversible. Currently, performing an upper endoscopy with biopsies of the esophagus is necessary to diagnose EoE. Current management of EoE includes food elimination diets, off label use of proton pump inhibitors, and glucocorticoid steroid formulations. 

""Eosinophilic Esophagitis - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Eosinophilic Esophagitis pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Eosinophilic Esophagitis treatment guidelines.

Familial Hypercholesterolemia Understanding
Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Overview
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common, inherited disorder of cholesterol metabolism characterized by very high plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The disease, if left untreated can leads to early heart attacks and heart disease. The diagnosis of both homozygous and heterozygous FH is based primarily on the finding of severe low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) elevations in the absence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia. Treatment of FH is focused on reducing the LDL-C levels in order to decrease the risk for heart disease. Pharmacotherapy involves medicines like statin drug, and other cholesterol-lowering medications such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, bempedoic acid and icosapent ethyl or PCSK9 inhibitors like Praluent may be used. Lifestyle intervention and exercise are also helpful along with medication.

Friedreich’s ataxia Understanding

Friedreich’s ataxia: Overview
Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder, with a typical age of onset between 10 and 15 years. Initial symptoms may include unsteady posture, frequent falling, and progressive difficulty in walking due to impaired ability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia). Affected individuals often develop slurred speech (dysarthria), characteristic foot deformities, and an irregular curvature of the spine (scoliosis).
FRDA is often associated with cardiomyopathy, a disease of cardiac muscle that may lead to heart failure or irregularities in heart rhythm (cardiac arrhythmias). About a third of the people with FRDA develop diabetes mellitus. The symptoms and clinical findings associated with FRDA result primarily from degenerative changes in the sensory nerve fibers at the point where they enter the spinal cord in structures known as dorsal root ganglia. This results in secondary degeneration of nerve fibers in the spinal cord which leads to a deficiency of sensory signals to the cerebellum, the part of the brain that helps to coordinate voluntary movements. 
FRDA is caused by abnormalities (mutations) in the FXN gene and people with FRDA inherit a mutation from each parent, so they have mutations in both copies of their FXN gene. This pattern, wherein parents who are clinically unaffected because they only carry a single mutated FXN gene but can have a child who is affected because he / she inherits a mutation from both carrier parents, is called autosomal recessive inheritance.

Report Highlights

Mucopolysaccharidosis III Understanding
Mucopolysaccharidosis III: Overview
Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) is a multisystem lysosomal storage disease characterized by progressive central nervous system degeneration manifest as severe intellectual disability (ID), developmental regression, and other neurologic manifestations including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), behavioral problems, and sleep disturbances. Systemic manifestations can include musculoskeletal problems (joint stiffness, contractures, scoliosis, and hip dysplasia), hearing loss, respiratory tract and sinopulmonary infections, and cardiac disease (valvular thickening, defects in the cardiac conduction system). Children with MPS IIIA do not produce enough enzyme activity to break down a substance in the body called heparan sulfate. The lack of enzyme activity is due to a defective gene called N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH). To diagnose MPS III, mucopolysaccharides are usually first measured in urine, followed by measurement of enzyme activity in blood or a small skin sample. Increased heparan sulfate in urine, and a decrease in the activity of any one of the four enzymes (shown in the table above) is usually consistent with a diagnosis of MPS III and will identify the MPS III type (A, B, C or D). Treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome is symptomatic and supportive.

""Mucopolysaccharidosis III - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Myasthenia gravis Understanding

Myasthenia gravis: Overview
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disorder that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles your body uses for movement. It occurs when communication between nerve cells and muscles becomes impaired. This impairment prevents crucial muscle contractions from occurring, resulting in muscle weakness. According to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, MG is the most common primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. It’s a relatively rare condition that affects between 14 and 20 out of every 100,000 people in the United States.
The main symptom of MG is weakness in the voluntary skeletal muscles, which are muscles under your control. The failure of muscles to contract normally occurs because they can’t respond to nerve impulses. Without proper transmission of the impulse, the communication between nerve and muscle is blocked and weakness results. MG is a neuromuscular disorder that’s usually caused by an autoimmune problem. Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
There is no cure for MG. The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms and control the activity of your immune system. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants can be used to suppress the immune system. These medications help minimize the abnormal immune response that occurs in MG. Additionally, cholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine (Mestinon), can be used to increase communication between nerves and muscles.

Report Highlights

Myasthenia gravis Emerging Drugs
• Efgartigimod: Argenx
Efgartigimod is an investigational antibody fragment designed to reduce disease-causing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and block the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is widely expressed throughout the body and plays a central role in rescuing IgG antibodies from degradation. Blocking FcRn reduces IgG antibody levels representing a logical potential therapeutic approach for several autoimmune diseases known to be driven by disease-causing IgG antibodies, including: myasthenia gravis (MG), a chronic disease that causes muscle weakness. 
In March 2021, Argenx announced FDA Acceptance of BLA Filing for Efgartigimod for the treatment of Generalized Myasthenia Gravis.
Argenx is also on track to submit an application for efgartigimod to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in the first half of 2021 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the second half of 2021.
• Inebilizumab: Viela Bio
A humanized, affinity-optimized, afucosylated IgG1 kappa (IgG1?) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the B cell-specific surface antigen CD19. It is currently in phase III and is being developed by Viela Bio.

Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) Understanding
Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP): Overview
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), also known as chronic relapsing polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. CIDP is caused by damage to the myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves. Symptoms for CIDP include tingling or numbness (beginning in the toes and fingers), weakness of the arms and legs, loss of deep tendon reflexes, fatigue, and abnormal sensations. The diagnosis of CIDP is based on a combination of clinical and electrophysiological criteria. Most therapies used to treat CIDP aim to block immune processes in order to stop inflammation and demyelination, in addition to preventing secondary axonal degeneration. Treatment for CIDP includes corticosteroids alone or in combination with immunosuppressant drugs. Plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy and physiotherapy are also effective.

Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis Understanding
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: Overview
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the most common chronic rheumatologic disease in children and is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. The etiology is unknown, and the genetic component is complex, making clear distinctions between the various subtypes difficult. A new nomenclature, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is being increasingly used to provide better definition of subgroups. Symptoms may appear during episodes (flare-ups). Or they may be ongoing (chronic). Each child’s symptoms can vary. Symptoms may include: Swollen, stiff, and painful joints in the knees, hands, feet, ankles, shoulders, elbows, or other joints, often in the morning or after a nap, Eye inflammation, Warmth and redness in a joint, Less ability to use one or more joints, Fatigue, Decreased appetite, poor weight gain, and slow growth, High fever and rash (in systemic JIA), Swollen lymph nodes. Diagnosing JIA may be difficult. There is no single test to confirm the disease. Various treatments can effectively manage and minimize the effects of JIA. Healthcare providers usually recommend a combination of treatments to relieve pain and swelling and to maintain movement and strength.

Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy Understanding

Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy: Overview
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is often characterized by bilateral, painless subacute loss of central vision during young adult life. In most cases, symptoms begin with one eye first, followed a few weeks later by visual failure in the other eye. Extremely rarely there may be neurologic abnormalities, such as peripheral neuropathy, postural tremor, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and it is strictly transmitted by maternal inheritance.
Individuals with LHON typically display symptoms in their young adult years. If vision is lost, then it usually occurs before 40 years of age. LHON is caused by genetic mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Some mothers with a LHON gene mutation do not show symptoms, but family history often reveals female relatives with visual loss at an early age. 
Affected individuals should receive supportive management and treatment through the usage of visual aids, occupational rehabilitation, and local social services. Small studies have shown that therapies involving ubiquinone and idebenone may provide possible benefits during the acute and chronic phases of the disorder. Affected individuals should avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing mitochondrial impairments.

• GS 010: GenSight Biologics
LUMEVOQ (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform, arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris, which, when associated with the gene of interest, allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein, which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. “LUMEVOQ” was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018. LUMEVOQ is currently in the review phase of its registration process in Europe, and in Phase III to move forward to a BLA filing in the U.S.  
• NFS-02: Neurophth Therapeutics
Neurophth is currently developing NFS-01 (NR082, rAAV-ND4) to treat LHON diseases caused by G11778A (ND4) site mutation and G3460A (ND1) site mutation, respectively. The mechanism of action is to leverage gene therapy strategy and use recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector to deliver the correct genes to the patients' damaged optic ganglion cells through introvitinreous injection, thus repair the mitochondrial biological respiratory chain, and restore the vitality and visual function of optic ganglion cells. 
NFS-01 (NR082, rAAV-ND4) was designated as orphan drug by the U.S. FDA in September 2020, which laid a foundation for accelerating international development of this product.

Systemic Mastocytosis Understanding
Systemic Mastocytosis: Overview
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a form of mastocytosis in which mast cells accumulate in internal tissues and organs such as the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and small intestines. It is typically diagnosed in adults. Signs and symptoms vary based on which parts of the body are affected. Too many mast cells can build up in the skin, liver, spleen, bone marrow or intestines. Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected. Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include: Flushing, itching or hives, Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, Anemia or bleeding disorders, Bone and muscle pain, Enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes, Depression, mood changes or problems concentrating. The disorder is usually caused by somatic changes (mutations) in the KIT gene. Diagnosis can include the following studies and should be conducted by a physician with special knowledge of this disorder: Skin and bone marrow biopsies, Measurement of mast cell mediators in blood and urine, Blood count, Liver function studies, and Genetic tests. The objective of treatment is to control the effects of mast cell released mediators by avoidance of dietary and environmental triggers as well as the use of various medications.

Small Cell Lung Cancer Understanding
Small Cell Lung Cancer: Overview
Small cell lung cancer is fast-growing lung cancer that develops in the tissues of the lungs. It is the least common type of lung cancer and characterized by rapid, uncontrolled growth of certain cells in the lungs. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), previously known as oat cell carcinoma, is considered distinct from other lung cancers, which are called non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) because of their clinical and biologic characteristics. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) arises in peribronchial locations and infiltrates the bronchial submucosa. Symptoms of SCLC are chest pain, chronic cough, coughing up blood, difficulty breathing, facial swelling, fatigue, hoarseness, loss of appetite, swollen neck veins, weight loss, and wheezing. The standard treatment for first- and second-line management of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is chemotherapy. Immunotherapy has also made progress in the treatment of SCLC including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab.

Phenylketonuria Understanding
Phenylketonuria: Overview
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that is detectable during the first days of life via routine newborn screening. PKU is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. PKU is characterized by absence or deficiency of an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), responsible for processing the amino acid phenylalanine. Infants with PKU typically appear normal at birth. With early screening and dietary treatment, affected individuals may never show symptoms of PKU. Symptoms may include vomiting, irritability, and/or a red skin rash with small pimples. Neurological symptoms are present in some untreated patients with PKU, including seizures, abnormal muscle movements, tight muscles, increased reflexes, involuntary movements, or tremor. The goal of treatment for PKU is to keep plasma phenylalanine levels within 120-360 umol/L (2-6 mg/dL). This is generally achieved through carefully planned and monitored diet.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) Understanding
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD): Overview
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare, X-linked metabolic disorder. ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that affect the production of adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) and subsequently cause toxic accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) primarily in the adrenal cortex and white matter of the brain and spinal cord. This brain disorder destroys myelin, the protective sheath that surrounds the brain’s neurons. Childhood Cerebral ALD is the most devastating form of adrenoleukodystrophy. Signs and symptoms of the adrenomyeloneuropathy type appear between early adulthood and middle age. Affected individuals develop progressive stiffness and weakness in their legs (paraparesis), experience urinary and genital tract disorders, and often show changes in behavior and thinking ability. Diagnosis of ALD is based on physical examination and various tests like blood testing, MRI, vision screening, skin biopsy and fibroblast cell culture. Stem cell transplant effective treatment option for cerebral ALD. Gene therapy is being evaluated as a potential treatment for cerebral ALD.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Understanding
Primary Biliary Cholangitis: Overview
Primary Biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously called primary biliary cirrhosis, is a chronic liver disease resulting from progressive destruction of the bile ducts in the liver. The common symptoms of primary biliary cholangitis are feeling tired and having itchy skin. Many people have no symptoms when they are first diagnosed. Women are nine times more likely than men to develop PBC. The diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis is done based upon patient history and physical examination. Liver function tests, blood test, ultrasound, CT scan, and/or MRI are done to confirm the diagnosis. Ursodiol (Actigal) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first line of treatment for PBC. Intense itching is one of the most common symptoms of PBC. Over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be helpful. Other agents such as rifampicin, naltrexone, cholestyramine and sertraline may also be prescribed.

Sezary syndrome: Overview
Sezary syndrome is an aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma which is a group of disorders that occur when T-cells (a type of white blood cell) become cancerous and affect the skin. It is characterized by a widespread red rash that may cover most of the body, the presence of cancerous T cells (called Sezary cells) in the blood, and abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.
The signs and symptoms of this condition can vary but may include: A red, itchy rash that covers large portions of the body, enlarged lymph nodes, alopecia (hair loss), thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, ectropion, hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen). Affected people may also have an increased risk of developing another lymphoma or other type of cancer
In general, there are six different treatment options available to people with Sezary syndrome. These include: Photodynamic therapy,Radiation therapy, Chemotherapy, Other drug therapy (i.e. topical steriods, retinoids), Biologic therapy, Targeted therapy. Mogamulizumab (Poteligeo) was approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary syndrome (SS) after at least one prior systemic therapy.

Pulmonary Sarcoidosis Understanding

Pulmonary Sarcoidosis: Overview
Sarcoidosis is a rare disease caused by inflammation. It usually occurs in the lungs and lymph nodes, but it can occur in almost any organ. Sarcoidosis in the lungs is called pulmonary sarcoidosis. It causes small lumps of inflammatory cells in the lungs. These lumps are called granulomas and can affect how the lungs work. The cause of pulmonary sarcoidosis is unknown. Experts think that bacteria, viruses, or chemicals might trigger the disease. It may also be genetic.  The following are the most common symptoms of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Symptoms may include: Shortness of breath, which often gets worse with activity, dry cough that will not go away, chest pain, wheezing. Pulmonary sarcoidosis is diagnosed through Chest X-ray, CT scan, pulmonary function tests, blood tests, bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung biopsy. Treatment is generally done to control symptoms and improve the function of organs affected by the disease. Steroid medicine, such as prednisone, may help reduce inflammation. Other medicines, such as methotrexate, may be used in severe cases or if steroids don’t work. 

Report Highlights

Oropharyngeal cancer Understanding
Oropharyngeal cancer: Overview
Oropharyngeal cancer is cancer in the oropharynx, which is the middle part of your throat (pharynx). The oropharynx includes the back one-third of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate and the side and back walls of the throat. Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer that accounts for about 18,000 newly diagnosed cases in the U.S. every year. Most oropharyngeal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, meaning that the cancer is affecting your squamous cells, which are thin flat cells found in the lining of most of your organs. And although rare, lymphoma, or cancer affecting cells in the lymphatic system, can also occur at the base of the tongue and tonsils, which are made up of lymph tissue. Symptoms include a sore throat that doesn’t go away; a lump in the throat, mouth or neck; coughing up blood; white patch in the mouth and other symptoms. The stages of oropharyngeal cancer span from Stage I (best prognosis) to Stage IV (worst prognosis). Oropharyngeal cancer diagnosis often begins with a physical exam conducted by doctor, or sometimes dentist, to check for any signs of abnormality such as a sore or lump in mouth or swollen lymph nodes in neck. Treatment for oropharyngeal cancer depends on several factors, including but not limited to: type of cancer, size of the tumor and location of the cancer, lymph nodes, speech and swallow function, and the patient’s overall medical condition.

• Cisplatin: AstraZeneca
Cisplatin works by stopping the cancer cells from multiplying. It does this by binding together the strands of the cells' genetic material, DNA. Cisplatin binds to the N7 reactive center on purine residues and as such can cause deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in cancer cells, blocking cell division and resulting in apoptotic cell death. The drug is being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials in combination with Durvalumab for the treatment of patients with Oropharyngeal cancer. 

• ISA101B: ISA Pharmaceuticals
ISA101 consists of 12 synthetic long peptides (25 to 35 amino acids long) derived from the E6 and E7 oncogenic proteins of the HPV 16 virus, a strain responsible for over 50% of human cervical cancers and cervical intra-epithelial neoplasias, more than 85% of HPV-positive head and neck cancers, and similar substantial percentages of other premalignant and malignant HPV-induced lesions (such as VIN, vulvar cancer, AIN and anal cancer).

Myopia Understanding
Myopia: Overview
Myopia, commonly referred to as shortsightedness, is a common cause of visual disability throughout the world. The prevalence of myopia varies by country and by ethnic group, reaching as high as 70-90% in some Asian populations. Myopia occurs if the eyeball is too long or the cornea (the clear front cover of the eye) is too curved. As a result, the light entering the eye isn't focused correctly, and distant objects look blurred. While the exact cause of myopia is unknown, there is significant evidence that many people inherit myopia, or at least the tendency to develop myopia. People with myopia can have difficulty clearly seeing a movie or TV screen, a whiteboard in school or while driving. Generally, myopia first occurs in school-age children. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, it typically progresses until about age 20. However, myopia may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. Testing for myopia may use several procedures to measure how the eyes focus light and to determine the power of any optical lenses needed to correct the reduced vision. Glasses or contact lenses can correct myopia in children and adults. For adults only (with rare exceptions for children), there are several types of refractive surgeries that can also correct myopia.

Myocardial infarction Understanding
Myocardial infarction: Overview
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a term used for an event of heart attack which is due to formation of plaques in the interior walls of the arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart and injuring heart muscles because of lack of oxygen supply. The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting, abnormal heart beating, anxiety, fatigue, weakness, stress, depression, and other factors. The immediate treatment of MI include, taking aspirin, which prevents blood from clotting, and nitro-glycerin to treat chest pain and oxygen. The heart attack can be prevented by taking an earlier action to lower those risks by controlling diet, fat, cholesterol, salt, smoking, nicotine, alcohol, drugs, monitoring of blood pressure every week, doing exercise every day, and loosing body weight. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack.

Metachromatic Leukodystrophy Understanding

Metachromatic Leukodystrophy: Overview
Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by accumulation of fats called sulfatides. This causes the destruction of the protective fatty layer (myelin sheath) surrounding the nerves in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. There are three types of MLD based on the age symptoms appear: late-infantile MLD, juvenile MLD, and adult MLD.
MLD is caused by changes (mutations) in the ASA gene (also known as ARSA) and, in rare cases, the PSAP gene. MLD is first suspected by recognizing the characteristic pattern of progressive impairment. In the late-infantile form, the first signs are often difficult walking, which can present as new inability to fully lift the feet while walking (foot drop) or by toe walking. For adult MLD, the first signs are slurred speech and behavioral issues that include difficulty in school, behavior changes, and decreased ability in school. Individuals with juvenile MLD can present with motor or cognitive symptoms. In pre- or minimally symptomatic children, stem cell transplantation can be considered.

Metabolic Acidosis Understanding
Metabolic Acidosis: Overview
Metabolic acidosis is primary reduction in bicarbonate, typically with compensatory reduction in carbon dioxide partial pressure. Metabolic acidosis is a disturbance of the body acid-base balance in which there is excessive acidity of the blood. Metabolic acidosis can occur as a result of many different diseases, such as kidney failure, poisoning, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and shock. Symptoms and signs include nausea and vomiting, lethargy, and hyperpnea. A metabolic acidosis can be caused by three major mechanisms: increased acid production, bicarbonate loss, and decreased renal acid excretion. Diagnosis of metabolic acidosis is clinical and with arterial blood gas (ABG) and serum electrolyte measurement. There are no FDA-approved therapies for long-term treatment of metabolic acidosis. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Alkali therapy and diet also helps in balancing the acid amount.

Hypoparathyroidism Understanding
Hypoparathyroidism: Overview
Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition in which the parathyroid glands fail to produce sufficient amounts of parathyroid hormone or the parathyroid hormone produced lacks biologic activity. The symptoms of hypoparathyroidism occur due to low levels of calcium in the blood. The severity of the condition can range from mild symptoms such as a tingling or numbness in the fingers, toes or around the lips (paresthesias) to severe muscle cramps and muscle spasms. The muscle symptoms are often called tetany, a condition characterized by uncontrollable twitching and cramping spasms of certain muscles such as those of the hands, feet, legs, and arms. In rare cases, seizures or fits can occur, or the level of consciousness can be depressed.

Herpes zoster Understanding
Herpes zoster: Overview
Herpes zoster, also known as Shingles is a localized, blistering and painful rash caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The classic presentation of Herpes zoster starts with a prodrome of mild-to-moderate burning or tingling in or under the skin of a given dermatome, often accompanied by fever, chills, headache, stomach upset, and general malaise. The normal incubation period for varicella is 14–16 days.  A diagnosis of Herpes zoster is based on the symptoms and the appearance of the rash. The diagnosis can be confirmed with blood tests or by taking a sample of fluid from a blister and testing for the virus. The goal of treatment for Herpes zoster during the acute episode is to control symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment options include antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, and pain medications. The first line of treatment and the most widely used agents for zoster infection are antiviral agents. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are available antiviral agents.

Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis Understanding
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis: Overview
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a rare kidney disease characterized by dysfunction in the part of the kidney that filters blood (the glomeruli). FSGS, can be caused by a variety of conditions including diabetes, sickle cell disease, other kidney diseases, obesity, an infection, drug toxicity or by inherited abnormal genes. FSGS can be mainly divided into Primary FSGS, secondary FSGS, and Genetic FSGS. Diagnosis of FSGS is based on blood test, urine test, and/or a kidney biopsy. Detailed medical history, patient examination and laboratory tests are essential to distinguish between primary (idiopathic) and secondary forms of FSGS. The standard first-line treatment for FSGS is prednisone. The short-term goal of treatment is to stop protein spillage completely and the long-term goals of treatment include preventing relapses of protein in the urine and preventing the deterioration of kidney function.

Fallopian tube cancer Understanding
Fallopian tube cancer: Overview
Fallopian tube cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, which connect a woman's ovaries to their uterus. Fallopian tube cancer is very rare. Only about 1% of all reproductive cancers in women start in the fallopian tubes. The causes and risk factors for developing primary fallopian tube cancer are not known. In some cases, a woman may have a history of chronic infection and/or inflammation of the fallopian tubes (due to untreated sexually transmitted diseases, for example). It is also believed that not having children and not having used birth control pills can also put a woman at higher risk for developing fallopian tube cancer. The most common symptoms are abnormal vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, and/or abdominal pain. It is difficult to see something abnormal growing on the inside of a fallopian tube. This makes fallopian tube cancer difficult to diagnose. One of the most important steps in evaluating any patient with a gynecologic complaint is a proper pelvic examination. The treatment for fallopian tube cancer will take into account the patient's stage of the disease, medical history, current health and personal preference, and other factors. The goal of the treatment of fallopian tube cancer is to get rid of the cancer completely with minimal side effects.

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Fallopian tube cancer R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches for Fallopian tube cancer.

Dermatomyositis Understanding

Dermatomyositis: Overview
Dermatomyositis is a type of inflammatory myopathy characterized by inflammatory and degenerative changes of the muscles and skin. Associated symptoms and physical findings may vary widely from case to case as patients may present differently. Muscle abnormalities may begin with aches and weakness of the muscles of the trunk, upper arms, hips, and thighs (proximal muscles). Muscles may be stiff, sore, tender and, eventually, show signs of degeneration (atrophy). Dermatomyositis may be diagnosed based upon a detailed patient history, thorough clinical examination, detection of characteristic physical findings, and certain specialized tests. Glucocorticoids, particularly prednisone, are widely used in the treatment of dermatomyositis and are often used first-line. High dose glucocorticoid therapy may produce adverse side effects, particularly after prolonged use, such as a decrease in bone density, causing bones to become brittle and weakened (osteoporosis); increasing, “superimposed” muscle weakness due to effects of the medication (i.e., corticosteroid myopathy); tissue swelling (edema); peptic ulcers; elevated blood pressure; elevated blood sugar levels; weight gain with fat deposits in the abdomen, face, and/or back of the neck or other findings. 

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Dermatomyositis R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches for Dermatomyositis.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Understanding
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Overview
COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Long-term exposure to lung irritants that damage the lungs and the airways usually is the cause of COPD. Breathing in secondhand smoke, which is in the air from other people smoking; air pollution; or chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace also can contribute to COPD. Diagnosis is made upon the basis of medical history and physical examination. The most common test which is used for the appropriate diagnosis is called spirometry. It consists of a flexible tube that’s connected to a machine called a spirometer. It will measure how much air the lungs can hold and how fast an individual can blow air out of them. Other tests include, X-ray and CT scan. These tests create pictures of the structures inside the chest, such as heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show signs of COPD. COPD has no cure yet. However, lifestyle changes and treatments can help a person to feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease.


""Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication.

Chronic Lower Back Pain Understanding
Chronic Lower Back Pain: Overview
Low back pain that has been present for longer than three months is considered as chronic, although there is still no consensus about the definition of Chronic Lower Back Pain (CLBP). 5-10% of all low back pain patients will develop CLBP. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) has been associated with neurochemical, structural, and functional cortical changes of several brain regions including the somatosensory cortex. Complex processes of peripheral and central sensitization may influence the evolution of acute to chronic pain. Most patients that suffer from CLBP experience pain in the lower area of the back (lumbar and sacroiliac regions) and mobility impairment. Diagnosis of low back pain is done on the basis of physical examination and patient history, sometimes followed by x-rays, CT scan, MRI, or other medical tests. Treatment for CLBP includes medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle modification as well as other forms of exercise are also helpful.

Acute Kidney Injury Understanding
Acute Kidney Injury: Overview
Acute kidney injury (AKI), also known as acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage. AKI is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. Symptoms may include anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. There are numerous causes of AKI, mainly related to a focal mismatch between oxygen and nutrient delivery to the nephrons and increased energy demands. The diagnosis of AKI is based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and correction of electrolyte imbalances.

Lamellar Icthyosis Understanding
Lamellar Icthyosis: Overview
Lamellar ichthyosis (LI) is a rare genetic skin disorder that is present at birth. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Infants with this condition are typically born with a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include ectropion, lips that turn outwards, hair loss, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, nail abnormalities, dehydration and respiratory problems. Diagnosis of Lamellar ichthyosis can be done on the basis of medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory tests. Treatment generally includes topical applications. These creams often contain ceramides or cholesterol. Moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin may also be used. Sometimes, mild keratolytics or topical retinoids are used as treatment options.

Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome Understanding
Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome: Overview
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), formerly known as type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia, is a rare autosomal recessive monogenic disease caused by mutations in the LPL gene. The disease is characterized by hyperchylomicronemia and recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and/or acute, potentially fatal, pancreatitis. The most serious complication of FCS is acute, and often recurrent, pancreatitis secondary to severe hypertriglyceridemia. FCS is diagnosed by a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, and extreme elevations in triglyceride levels. Treatment for FCS aims to control blood triglyceride levels with a very low-fat diet. Traditional medications used to lower triglycerides are often ineffective in patients with FCS. Avoidance of alcohol and simple, refined carbohydrates, such as those found in sodas and candy, are also very important to prevent further rise in triglycerides.

Ovarian cancer Understanding
Ovarian cancer: Overview
Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in a woman’s ovaries – the small organs in the female reproductive system that create eggs. This kind of cancer can be difficult to detect because it often doesn’t cause any symptoms until later stages. Once found, ovarian cancer can be treated with chemotherapy and surgery to remove any tumors. As with most cancers, ovarian cancer becomes more common as a person gets older. The risk of ovarian cancer increases steeply from around 45 years and is greatest in those aged between 75 and 79 years. Between 5 and 15 out of 100 ovarian cancers (5 to 15%) are caused by an inherited faulty gene. Inherited genes that increase the risk of ovarian cancer include faulty versions of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Faults in these genes also increase the risk of breast cancer.

""Ovarian cancer - Pipeline Insight, 2021"" report by DelveInsight outlays comprehensive insights of present scenario and growth prospects across the indication. A detailed picture of the Ovarian cancer pipeline landscape is provided which includes the disease overview and Ovarian cancer treatment guidelines. The assessment part of the report embraces, in depth Ovarian cancer commercial assessment and clinical assessment of the pipeline products under development.

Ovarian cancer Emerging Drugs
• Atezolizumab: Genentech
Atezolizumab is a humanized kappa immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids) and is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc-effector function via a single amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results in a non-glycosylated antibody that has minimal binding to Fc receptors and, consequently, eliminates detectable Fc-effector function and depletion of cells expressing programmed death?ligand 1 (PD-L1) in humans. Atezolizumab targets human PD-L1 and inhibits its interaction with its receptors, programmed death?1 (PD-1) and B7.1, both of which can provide inhibitory signals to T cells. The drug is currently in phase 3 of clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

• Tisotumab Vedotin: Genmab
Tisotumab vedotin, also known as HuMax-TF, HuMax®-TF-ADC or TF-011-MMAE, is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeted to tissue factor (TF), a protein involved in tumor signaling and angiogenesis. Tisotumab vedotin includes an antibody targeting TF conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cleavable maleimidocaproyl-valyl-citrullinyl-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (mc-val-cit-PABC) type linker. The drug is currently in phase 2 of clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

• Pembrolizumab: Merck
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Spasmodic-torticollis Understanding
Spasmodic-torticollis: Overview
Cervical dystonia, also known as spasmodic torticollis, is a rare neurological disorder that originates in the brain. It is the most common form of focal dystonia in an office setting. Cervical dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions in the neck that cause abnormal movements and postures of the neck and head. In some cases, these abnormal contractions may be sustained or continuous; in others, they may be present as spasms that can resemble tremor. The severity of cervical dystonia can vary, but the disorder can cause significant pain and discomfort as well as difficulty due to the abnormal postures. It can affect quality of life and activities of daily living including employment. Cervical dystonia typically begins in middle age, and rarely begins in adolescence and young adulthood.

ASD is found in individuals around the world, regardless of race, culture, or economic background. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), autism does occur more often in boys than in girls, with a 4 to 1 male-to-female ratio. Autism symptoms typically become clearly evident during early childhood, between 12 and 24 months of age. However, symptoms may also appear earlier or later. There are no “cures” for autism, but therapies and other treatment considerations can help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Many treatment approaches involve therapies such as: behavioral therapy, play therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy.

Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome Understanding
Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome: Overview
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is an extremely rare disease characterized by low levels of circulating red blood cells due to their destruction (hemolytic anemia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) due to their consumption and inability of the kidneys to process waste products from the blood and excrete them into the urine (acute kidney failure), a condition known as uremia. It is a distinctly different illness from the more common disorder known as typical hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is caused by E.coli-producing Shiga toxins (Stx HUS) and is generally foodborne. The onset of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ranges from before birth (prenatally) to adulthood. In young children, the disorder often develops suddenly and usually follows an infection, particularly an upper respiratory infection or gastroenteritis. 
Most cases of aHUS are associated with mutations amongst the multiple genes that produce (encode) proteins involved in the alternate pathway of complement, which is part of the complement system of the innate immune system. Treatment by a medical team familiar with the unique challenges of aHUS is recommended and can include pediatricians or general internists, kidney specialists (nephrologists), intensive care physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers. Initially, affected individuals may receive supportive care including maintaining proper nutrition and electrolyte and fluid balance through intravenous feeding (parenteral) when and if necessary.

Crovalimab acts as inhibitors of Complement C5. It is being developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical/Roche for Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome and is currently in phase III stage of development. It is administered intravenously.
• rVA576: Akari Therapeutics
Nomacopan (rVA576) is a second-generation complement inhibitor which acts on complement component-C5, preventing release of C5a and formation of C5b–9 (also known as the membrane attack complex, or MAC), and independently also inhibits leukotriene B4, or LTB4, activity, both elements that are co-located as part of the immune/inflammatory response. Nomacopan is a recombinant small protein (16,740 Da) derived from a protein originally discovered in the saliva of the Ornithodoros moubata tick, where it modulates the host immune system to allow the parasite to feed without alerting the host to its presence or provoking an immune response. It is currently in phase III stage of development and is being developed by Akari Therapeutics.

Achromatopsia Understanding
Achromatopsia: Overview
Achromatopsia is a condition characterized by a partial or total absence of color vision. People with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors; they see only black, white, and shades of gray. Incomplete achromatopsia is a milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination. Achromatopsia also involves other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity).
Achromatopsia results from changes in one of several genes: CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C, or PDE6H. A particular CNGB3 gene mutation underlies the condition in Pingelapese islanders. Achromatopsia is a disorder of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina contains two types of light receptor cells, called rods and cones. These cells transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain through a process called phototransduction. Rods provide vision in low light (night vision). Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Mutations in any of the genes listed above prevent cones from reacting appropriately to light, which interferes with phototransduction.
Currently there is no cure for achromatopsia.  Several clinical trials for gene replacement therapy for CNGA3 and CNGB3-related achromatopsia are currently ongoing and recruiting patients.  There are also clinical observational trials that are recruiting patients for clinical evaluation to study the natural history of achromatopsia.  Animal models of achromatopsia in dogs and mice have shown promising results in restoring some cone function in the retina.

Report Highlights
• The companies and academics are working to assess challenges and seek opportunities that could influence Achromatopsia R&D. The therapies under development are focused on novel approaches for Achromatopsia.

Leptomeningeal Disease Understanding

Leptomeningeal Disease: Overview
Leptomeningeal metastases are a relatively uncommon but serious complication of cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. Most often seen in advanced cancers, leptomeningeal disease is increasing in incidence as people are living longer with advanced cancer. Leptomeningeal disease may also be referred to as carcinomatous meningitis or neoplastic meningitis. Most often with this complication, people have multiple neurological symptoms including visual changes, speech problems, weakness or numbness of one side of the body, loss of balance, confusion, or seizures.
The symptoms of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can vary significantly, and often include numerous neurological problems. Doctors use the term ""multifocal deficits"" to describe the variety of symptoms that may occur. Diagnosing leptomeningeal disease can be challenging, not only because of the overlap of symptoms with those of brain metastases, but because of the testing process.
The treatment of leptomeningeal metastases depends on many factors, including severity of symptoms, type of primary cancer, the person's general health, presence of other metastases, and more. Radiation therapy (or proton beam therapy) is the most rapidly effective of treatments for leptomeningeal disease. Because intravenously administered chemotherapy drugs don't usually cross the blood-brain barrier, these are frequently injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. This is referred to as intraventricular, CSF, or intrathecal chemotherapy.

Rotavirus infections Understanding
Rotavirus infections: Overview
Rotaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses that have a complex architecture of three concentric capsids that surround a genome of 11 segments of dsRNA. Rotavirus infections are a leading cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis in children <5 years of age. Rotavirus is the most common cause of inflammation of the stomach and intestines (gastroenteritis), leading to severe diarrhea in infants and children throughout the world. There are different strains of rotavirus, and multiple infections by different strains may occur. Symptoms of rotavirus tend to be most prominent in children. The most common symptom of rotavirus is severe diarrhea. Children can also experience: vomiting, severe fatigue, a high fever, irritability, dehydration, and abdominal pain. In terms of treatment, the goal is to stay hydrated and comfortable while the virus works its way out of the system. There aren’t any medications or treatments that will make the rotavirus go away. This includes antiviral medications, over-the-counter antidiarrheal drugs, and antibiotics.

Haemochromatosis Understanding
Haemochromatosis: Overview
Haemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder, which causes the body to absorb more iron than usual from food. Haemochromatosis is most commonly due to the autosomal recessive inheritance of a C282Y substitution in the HFE protein, whereby both alleles of the corresponding gene are affected. The disease is characterized by an inappropriate increase in intestinal iron absorption due to reduced expression of the iron regulatory protein, hepcidin. Symptoms of haemochromatosis usually start between the ages of 30 and 60. Common symptoms include: feeling very tired all the time (fatigue), weight loss, weakness, joint pain, an inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction), irregular periods or absent periods. There's currently no cure for haemochromatosis, but there are treatments that can reduce the amount of iron in the body and reduce the risk of damage. There are 2 main treatments: phlebotomy and chelation therapy.

Dopamine D1 receptor antagonists Understanding
Dopamine D1 receptor antagonists: Overview
Dopamine receptor D1, also known as DRD1, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DRD1 gene. D1 receptors are the most abundant kind of dopamine receptor in the central nervous system.

Function - D1 receptors regulate the growth of neurons, mediate some behaviors, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated events. They play a role in addiction by facilitating the gene expression changes that occur in the nucleus accumbens during addiction. They are Gs/a coupled and can stimulate neurons by indirectly activating cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.

Dopamine D1 receptor antagonists - Many typical and atypical antipsychotics are D1 receptor antagonists in addition to D2 receptor antagonists. No other D1 receptor antagonists have been approved for clinical use. Ecopipam is a selective D1-like receptor antagonist that has been studied clinically in humans in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, obesity, pathological gambling, and Tourette's syndrome, with efficacy in some of these conditions seen. The drug produced mild-to-moderate, reversible depression and anxiety in clinical studies however and has yet to complete development for any indication.

It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.

Dopamine D1 receptor antagonists Emerging Drugs
• Ecopipam (EBS-101): Emalex Biosciences
Ecopipam is an investigational first-in-class drug being evaluated in pediatric patients for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome (TS) and for childhood onset fluency disorder (Stuttering) in adults. Ecopipam selectively blocks the actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine at the D1 receptor. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its receptors have been classified into two “families” based on their genetic structure: “D1” (including subtypes D1 and D5) and “D2” (including subtypes D2, D3, and D4). D1-receptor super-sensitivity may be a mechanism for the repetitive and compulsive behaviors associated with Tourette Syndrome. Currently approved therapies for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome act at D2 dopamine receptors. The drug is currently in phase 3 of clinical trials.

• Olanzapine (INP-105) : Impel Neuropharma
INP105 is a drug-device combination product being studied for the treatment of acute agitation associated with bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia. It is comprised of an intranasal formulation of olanzapine and Impel’s proprietary Precision Olfactory Delivery, or POD, nasal delivery device. The POD device delivers olanzapine to the richly-vascularized upper nasal cavity offering rapid, consistent and optimized bioavailability that can be administered by the patient or a caregiver. Olanzapine is the most commonly used treatment for acute agitation, but its use is limited to intramuscular injection. INP105 is intended to be suitable for use in the hospital emergency room setting as well as early in an episode where it could be self-administered in the patient’s home or supportive care setting. The drug is currently in phase 2 of clinical trials.

CXCR4 receptor antagonists Understanding
CXCR4 receptor antagonists: Overview
CXCR4 is a 352 amino acid rhodopsin-like GPCR, comprising an extracellular N-terminal domain, 7 transmembrane (TM) helices, 3 extra-cellular loops (ECL), 3 intra-cellular loops (ICL) and an intracellular C-terminal domain. CXCR4 can exist in the plasma membrane as a monomer, dimer, higher-order oligomer or nanoclusters. 

Function - CXCR4 can control cell proliferation in addition to directing cell retention and movement, both in physiological processes, such as development and tissue regeneration, and in pathological ones, such as cancer growth. Signal transduction pathways downstream CXCR4 eventually control both cell movement and cell proliferation, which are both dependent on PI3K-Akt and mTORC signaling; the details, however, may vary from cell to cell and in different settings.

CXCR4 receptor antagonists - CXCR4 antagonists can disrupt adhesive tumor–stroma interactions and mobilize leukemia cells from their protective stromal microenvironment, making them more accessible to conventional drugs. Therefore, targeting the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is a novel, attractive therapeutic approach that is explored in ongoing clinical trials in leukemia patients. Initially, CXCR4 antagonists were developed for the treatment of HIV, where CXCR4 functions as a co-receptor for virus entry into T cells. The diverse role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in the pathogenesis of HIV, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, has established CXCR4 as a promising therapeutic target. Considering the vast population of patients with these diseases, the development of CXCR4 antagonists is of therapeutic as well as economic importance.

Complement C1 inhibitors Understanding
Complement C1 inhibitors: Overview
Complement C1 is the defining component of the classical pathway. Within the C1qC1r2C1s2 complex, C1q functions as a molecular scaffold for C1r2C1s2 and C1q binding to its ligands activates these two serine proteases. The classic C1q ligands are antigen-bound antibodies and activated C1s cleaves C4 and C2 to initiate the complement cascade.

Function - Activation of the C1 complex initiates the classical complement pathway. This occurs when C1q binds to antigen-antibody complexes. The antibodies IgM or certain subclasses of IgG complexed with antigens are able to initiate the complement system: a single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several monomeric IgG molecules are needed. C1q can also be activated in other ways, for example by binding to pentraxins such as C-reactive protein or directly to the surface of pathogens.
Complement C1 inhibitors - C1 inhibitor is a protease inhibitor that targets C1r and C1s enzymes of the classical pathway of complement, Hageman factor (factor XII) of the coagulation pathway, and the kallikrein system.

• Sutimlimab : Bioverativ
Sutimlimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to C1s, a protein that is part of the classical complement pathway. In this way, the treatment may block all of the downstream steps in the C1s-mediated complement pathway, and potentially reduce RBC lysis. The treatment may, therefore, be able to prevent hemolytic anemia in CAD patients.The advantage of sutimlimab is that it blocks only one of the three arms of the complement pathway, and does not affect the other two pathways — the lectin and alternative pathways. Therefore, sutimlimab ensures that the complement pathway is not totally ineffective. The drug is currently in preregistration stage of development.

• ANX007 : Annexon
ANX007 is a clinical-stage investigational monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) for the treatment of patients with complement-mediated neurodegenerative ophthalmic diseases. Formulated for IVT administration, ANX007 is designed to potently bind to C1q and inhibit activation of all downstream components of the classical complement cascade, including C3 and C5, but to not interfere with the normal function of C3 and C5 as part of other complement pathways. The drug is currently in phase II of development.

Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists Understanding
Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists: Overview
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are adrenal hormones involved in the stress response, regulating processes such as immune function and metabolism. Glucocorticoids mediate numerous essential processes in the human body via binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).  Excessive GR signaling can cause disease, and GR antagonists can be used to treat many symptoms of glucocorticoid-induced pathology. 

Function – Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR, or GCR) also known as NR3C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1) is the receptor to which cortisol and other glucocorticoids bind. When the glucocorticoid receptor binds to glucocorticoids, its primary mechanism of action is the regulation of gene transcription. The unbound receptor resides in the cytosol of the cell. After the receptor is bound to glucocorticoid, the receptor-glucorticoid complex can take either of two paths. The activated GR complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus or represses the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus.

Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists- Increased cortisol levels have been observed in patients suffering from a number of metabolic and psychiatric disorders. Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists which block cortisol effects might have a benefit in both the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

Type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonists Understanding
Type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonists: Overview
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) play an important role in embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cell proliferation and differentiation. FGFR1 is a member of the Fibroblast Growth Factor family, comprising of 4 receptors and 18 Ligands. FGFR1 signalling downstream functions mainly via PI3K and MAPK pathways. Several ways of involvement of FGFR1 in cancer have been proposed: auto- and paracrine activation, amplification and overexpression. 

Function – The FGFR1 protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein is inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning allows the FGFR1 protein to interact with other proteins called fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. When an FGF attaches to the FGFR1 protein, the receptor triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. This signaling is thought to play an important role in the development and growth of several parts of the body, including the brain, bones of the head and face (craniofacial bones), bones in the hands and feet, and the long bones in the arms and legs.

Type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonists- Frequent tumor fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) alterations are seen in many cancers, and include genetic amplifications, mutations, rearrangements and fusions. FGFR inhibitors target these receptor alterations and show promise as a drug class. FGF signaling inhibition dramatically reduces revascularization, hitting upon one of the hallmarks of cancers, angiogenesis, and reduces tumor burden in human tumors that depend on autocrine FGF signaling

Cannabinoid receptor CB1 inverse agonists Understanding
Cannabinoid receptor CB1 inverse agonists: Overview
The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the most abundantly expressed G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the brain. CB1 elicits its physiological responses by coupling primarily to Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP signaling. 

Function – CB1R is encoded by the gene CNR1 and consists of 472 amino acids in humans (473 amino acids in rat and mouse, with 97–99% amino acid sequence identity among these species). The full-length CB1R dominates in the brain and skeletal muscle, whereas the CB1Rb (with 33 amino acid deletion at the N-terminus) shows a higher expression level in the liver and pancreatic islet cells where it is involved in metabolism.The CB1 receptor is a pre-synaptic heteroreceptor that modulates neurotransmitter release when activated in a dose-dependent, stereoselective and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner.The CB1 receptor is activated by cannabinoids, generated naturally inside the body (endocannabinoids) or introduced into the body as cannabis or a related synthetic compound. 

Cannabinoid receptor CB1 inverse agonists- Increased cortisol levels have been observed in patients suffering from a number of metabolic and psychiatric disorders. Cannabinoid receptor CB1 inverse agonists which block cortisol effects might have a benefit in both the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. These types of molecules inhibit the signal induced by the CB1 receptor, and even reverse its biological response (e.g.: no signal to seek food, signal to increase energy expenditure and speed up metabolism at rest, no fibrogenesis or even reverse fibrogenesis).

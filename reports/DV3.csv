Marginal Zone Lymphoma Disease Understanding and Treatment Algorithm
Marginal Zone Lymphoma Overview
Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma or Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) is a group of indolent (slow-growing) NHL B-cell lymphomas, which account for approximately 5?17% of all NHL cases. In the World Health Organization classification, there are three different MZL entities with specific diagnostic criteria, behavior, and therapeutic implications: the extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type (MALT lymphoma), the splenic MZL (SMZL), and the nodal MZL (NMZL).
Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, also known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma: This is the most common type of marginal zone lymphoma. It starts in places other than the lymph nodes (extranodal). Nodal MZL (sometimes called monocytoid B-cell lymphoma) occurs within the lymph nodes and accounts for about 10% of all MZL cases. In most cases, it is not known what causes nodal MZL. It is more common in people who have been infected with the hepatitis C virus and some autoimmune conditions than others. Splenic MZL occurs most often in the spleen and blood. It has been associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is a low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma characterized by massive splenomegaly, moderate lymphocytosis with or without villous lymphocytes, rare involvement of peripheral lymph nodes, and indolent clinical course.

?
Marginal Zone Lymphoma Diagnosis 
To make a diagnosis, the doctor would need to stage the disease. Staging is also how the doctor decides the right treatment. It involves evaluating the location and size of the tumors and determining whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The diagnosis can be established based on the endoscopic appearance. The endoscopist must take specimens from the antrum and the corpus for the urease test. If the examined segments are unsuspicious, a biopsy must be performed from each quadrant of the fundus, the corpus, and the antrum and ten biopsies if they are suspicious, to request a histological workup.

Treatment selection for a patient with Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) depends on the type, stage, and location of the disease. Since gastric MALT lymphoma is often the result of an infection with H. pylori, the initial treatment is antibiotic therapy, usually combined with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The most commonly used regimen is triple therapy: a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) in association with amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Metronidazole can be substituted for amoxicillin in penicillin-allergic individuals. If the lymphoma relapses (disease returns after treatment) or becomes refractory (disease does not respond to treatment) after antibiotic therapy, there are many additional treatment options available, including rituximab, radiation therapy, and surgery. For SMZL, the recognized therapeutic options are splenectomy, chemotherapy (ChT), rituximab alone, or rituximab plus chemotherapy. Nodal MZL usually responds well to chemotherapy. It may be given as a single drug or a combination of drugs and is often given with a targeted therapy drug. Single drugs that may be used for nodal MZL are fludarabine (Fludara), bendamustine (Treanda). Combinations of chemotherapy drugs that may be used are: CHOP,R-CHOP,CVP,R-CVP and BR.

Imbruvica (ibrutinib): AbbVie, Janssen Biotech
Ibrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. The drug forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. BTK’s role in signaling through the B-cell surface receptors results in the activation of pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical studies show that ibrutinib inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.
The recommended dose of Imbruvica for MCL and MZL is 560 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Marginal Zone Lymphoma Emerging Drugs 
Umbralisib (TGR-1202): TG Therapeutics
Umbralisib (TGR-1202) is an orally administered, investigational dual inhibitor of PI3K delta and CK1 epsilon, which is administered orally once daily. The phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes involved in many important cellular functions, including cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intracellular trafficking, and immunity. There are four isoforms of PI3K (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma), of which the delta isoform is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Dysregulation of the PI3K pathway is among one of the most commonly mutated pathways across all of cancer biology.
Currently, TG Therapeutics is investigating the drug in Phase II/III clinical in a combination of ublituximab, with or without Bendamustine, and TGR-1202 alone in patients with previously treated non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).

Aliqopa (Copanlisib): Bayer
Aliqopa (Copanlisib) is an intravenously administered, small molecule with inhibitory activity against all four isoforms including the PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. The PI3K pathway is involved in cell growth, survival, and metabolism, and its dysregulation plays an important role in the development of lymphoma. The drug is also the only PI3K inhibitor administered intravenously on an intermittent schedule: on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Copanlisib is currently approved in the US and Taiwan under the brand name Aliqopa for relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL). In September 2017, the US FDA granted accelerated approval to the drug for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. The drug is currently in phase III for MZL.

Ublituximab: TG Therapeutics
Ublituximab (TG-1101) is an investigational glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope on CD20-expressing B-cells. When ublituximab binds to the B-cell, it triggers a series of immunological reactions (including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [ADCC] and complement-dependent cytotoxicity [CDC]), leading to the destruction of the cell. Additionally, ublituximab is uniquely designed, to lack certain sugar molecules normally expressed on the antibody. Removal of these sugar molecules, a process called glycoengineering, has been shown to enhance the potency of ublituximab, especially the ADCC activity.

Marginal Zone Lymphoma Market Outlook
A Marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) involves immune cells known as B-cells and accounts for between 5% and 17% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The three main subtypes of MZL are extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma), nodal MZL, and splenic MZL. Of these, MALT lymphoma is the most common. The symptoms that may be caused by MZL depend on the type and location of the MZL. MALT lymphoma commonly involves the stomach, and patients may report abdominal pain, heartburn, and indigestion. MALT lymphoma may also develop in other areas of the body, such as the area around the eye, the salivary glands, or the lungs. Splenic MZL may be detected because of the enlargement of the spleen or abnormal blood cell counts. These types of lymphoma tend to be indolent (slow-growing).
Due to the slow nature of progression, most patients tend to present before developing significant complications. In the rare cases of life or organ-threatening MZL, high-dose corticosteroids (for example, dexamethasone 40 mg daily) can be used to temporize matters before starting more definitive (Immuno) chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Treatment of indolent lymphoma should be individualized according to the disease subtype, presentation, comorbid conditions, and patient preferences. When possible, the goal of therapy is to cure the disease and/or prolong survival. In all cases, the goal should be to improve quality of life; care must be taken to avoid overtreatment. 
There are several different treatment approaches for SMZL, including single-agent rituximab, splenectomy, and traditional chemotherapy. For localized disease, local therapy is recommended such as triple therapy for H. pylori in gastric extranodal MZL, splenectomy for splenic MZL, and radiotherapy for nodal MZL. Also, most patients with nodal MZL present with advanced-stage disease and are not likely to achieve a cure, even with aggressive chemotherapy regimens. For a disseminated disease with a low tumor burden, a watch and wait or single-agent rituximab can be used. However, for symptomatic disease, a similar approach to follicular lymphoma (FL) can be used with chemoimmunotherapy approaches such as bendamustine and rituximab. 
Patients with the relapsing disease after at least one CD20-based therapy have several recently approved chemotherapy-free options including B-cell receptor inhibitors such as ibrutinib (approved specifically in MZL) and immunomodulatory agents, such as lenalidomide and rituximab (FDA approved in MZL and FL). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors have shown excellent activity in iNHL, specifically in MZL, with breakthrough designation status for copanlisib and umbralisib, allowing off label use of this class of agents in clinical practice.
Patients with early-stage MALT lymphoma with no underlying infectious etiology, or those for whom antibiotic therapy has failed, can be effectively managed with external beam radiotherapy. Rarely, marginal zone lymphoma can transform into a more aggressive lymphoma, typically DLBCL. These patients require aggressive therapy and may benefit from autologous stem cell transplantation. Although the aggressive subtype may resolve completely, patients are often left with a persistent low-grade lymphoma.

STS with lung metastases Disease Understanding and Treatment Algorithm
STS with lung metastases Overview
Soft tissue sarcoma is a broad term for cancers that start in soft tissues (muscle, tendons, fat, lymph and blood vessels, and nerves). These cancers can develop anywhere in the body but are found mostly in the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen. For patients with STS, the lungs are the most common site of metastatic disease. Although pulmonary metastases most commonly arise from primary tumors in the extremities, they may arise from almost any primary site or histology. It was also analyzed that, approximately 20–25% of all STS patients will develop pulmonary metastases (40–60% for high-grade tumors), which will become clinically evident usually in the first 2 years following diagnosis. For extremity STS, radiotherapy, in addition to surgical removal of the tumor has been shown to reduce the risk of local recurrence, but it has no impact on survival. However, guidelines for the performance of pulmonary metastasectomy for STS do not exist, and decisions to operate are often made on an individual basis. Up to half of the STS, patients develop one or more lung metastases. Without effective systemic therapies, doctors often rely on pulmonary metastasectomy, surgical removal of the pulmonary metastases, although current data for the practice specific to STS are limited. Lung metastasis produces symptoms similar to those of other serious lung or chest ailments. It is possible, however, for lung metastases to present no symptoms at all. Sometimes the cancerous growth is discovered by accident when the doctor takes a chest x-ray of the patient for other reasons
?
STS with lung metastases Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of STS are mainly made by doing Imaging tests and by biopsy; however, the test is done after signs and symptoms occur. A regular x-ray of the area with the lump may be the first test ordered. A chest x-ray may be done after diagnosis to see if the sarcoma has spread to the lungs. A CT scan uses x-rays to make detailed cross-sectional images of the body. This test is also used to see if the sarcoma has spread to the lungs, liver, or other organs.

STS with lung metastases Treatment 
Metastases is a type of lung tumor that develops when cancer from another body site. When this occurs, the tumors in the lung are referred to as metastatic lung (pulmonary) tumors. Because it acts as a sieve for all of the blood that passes through the body, the lung is a very common site for metastatic tumors to lodge. Fortunately, patients with tumors that spread to the lung from other sites often still have a chance to be cured by surgical removal of these tumors, frequently in combination with chemotherapy. Early on, surgical therapy for sarcoma metastases was based on gaining adequate access and visualization to perform a complete resection, including removal of any occult or residual disease. Standard posterolateral thoracotomy provided excellent visualization and allowed the surgeon to examine the entire pleural surface. In surgery for pulmonary metastases complete resection of all lesions and preservation of lung parenchyma is of utmost importance. Pulmonary metastasectomy is performed heterogeneously not only concerning the surgical approach (open vs. VATS) but also to resection techniques (e.g., laser enucleation, electrocautery resection, stapling)
STS with lung metastases Epidemiology   
The disease epidemiology covered in the report provides historical as well as forecasted epidemiology segmented by  Total Incident cases of STS (Soft tissue sarcoma),Total incident cases of STS with lung metastases, Gender-specific incident cases of STS with lung metastases, and Subtype-specific incident cases of STS with lung metastases scenario in the 7MM covering the United States, EU5 countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and Japan from 2017 to 2030.
Key Findings
• As per DelveInsight estimates, the incident cases of STS with lung metastases in the 7MM was 7,871 cases in 2017.
• The estimates suggest a higher incidence of STS with lung metastases in the United States with 2,506 cases in 2017.
• Females accounted for a larger percentage among the STS with lung metastases cases as compared to males. In 2017, a lower number of males were affected by this disease, i.e., 42% of the total incident cases of STS with lung metastases population in the United States, which is equivalent to 1,053 cases. In comparison to this, for females, the number of cases observed was 1,454 in 2017.
• Among the total incidence of STS with lung metastases cases in the United States, there were 777 cases of Leiomyosarcoma, and 150 cases of liposarcoma, followed by synovial with 376 cases and other types with 1,203 cases.

STS with lung metastases Emerging Drugs 
Annamycin: Moleculin
Annamycin is a unique next-generation liposome formulated anthracycline (also referred to in the literature as “L-Annamycin”) that has been designed to eliminate cardiotoxicity and avoid the multidrug resistance mechanisms that often defeat currently approved anthracyclines. Annamycin was discovered by Professor Waldemar Priebe at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Anthracyclines are a class of chemotherapy drugs considered to be among the most effectively available, and with a broader spectrum of anticancer activity than most other classes of chemotherapeutic agents. They have been recognized for their pleiotropic (producing or having multiple effects) mechanisms of action and for DNA being their primary target. In particular, anthracyclines interfere with an enzyme called “topoisomerase II,” resulting in damage to the DNA of rapidly replicating tumor cells; such DNA damage leads to tumor cell death in a process called “apoptosis” (programmed cell death)

STS with lung metastases Market Outlook
STS has many histologic subtypes, and the malignancy can be low or high grade. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these therapies. There have been many attempts to improve the treatment outcome of locally advanced or locally relapsed disease by combining local treatment (surgery, radiotherapy) with systemic therapy, such as neoadjuvant (preoperative) or adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy. However, only limited data are available, supporting the use of such perioperative treatments in sarcoma. Metastasectomy and/or chemotherapy are the most common treatments offered to patients with metastatic sarcoma. Pulmonary metastasectomy, either video-assisted or through a formal thoracotomy, has been shown to increase overall survival in select populations of both osseous and STS patients. While chemotherapy remains an essential tool for the treatment of patients with metastatic sarcoma, there is mixed evidence on its survival impact. 
Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases and chemotherapy are treatment options that have been employed, but many patients are poor candidates for these treatments for multiple host or tumor-related reasons. In this group of patients, radiation might provide a less morbid treatment alternative. Furthermore, many older patients, as a result of various tumor or comorbidity-related issues, are deemed poor candidates for surgery or chemotherapy. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) has been shown to decrease local recurrence when used in conjunction with surgery for primary localized STS. The use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma to the lung has been shown to be safe and effective. Previous reports on the use of SBRT for metastatic sarcoma to the lungs exist but are limited by small patient numbers and limited long-term follow-up.
Navarria et al., 2015b, conducted a study which stated that before SBRT, 36% of patients underwent surgical resection for other lung metastases, 18% of patients received chemotherapy, and seven (25%) patients received both treatments; SBRT was performed as the first treatment in 21% patients.
The pipeline of STS with lung metastases possesses potential drugs as monotherapies as well as combination therapies.
Key Findings
• The market size of STS with lung metastases in the 7MM was USD 177.54 million in 2017.
• Among the EU-5 countries, Germany has the highest market size of USD 23.71 million. The lowest market size was estimated in Italy, i.e., USD 11.40 million in 2017.
• Around 65% of patients taking the first-line treatment experience relapse of the disease and go for second-line treatment. Since there are no approved or emerging therapies for relapsed/refractory treatment, the therapies which are used in the first-line are used again in second-line management. 
• The market size generated by surgery, off-label treatment, and SBRT (first line & second line treatment) in 2017 in the 7MM was estimated to be USD 110.52 million, USD 32.08 million, and USD 34.95 million, respectively.

The product details cover mechanism of action, dosage and administration, route of synthesis, and Research and development activity including regulatory milestones, and other development activities. Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.
Drug Summary 
RT-100 is an investigational gene therapy product that is infused during cardiac catheterization – a commonly performed outpatient procedure similar to an angiography – directly into the arteries that feed the heart. This method of gene transfer has been shown to safely and efficiently deliver AC6 directly to heart muscle cells. The gene encoding human AC6 is delivered via a modified adenovirus vector that is able to enter the cells but cannot reproduce itself (Ad5.hAC6). The AC6 is taken in by the heart and has been shown to persist in heart muscle cells. Unlike small molecule drug treatments, which work to decrease demands on the body, this gene therapy is aimed at improving overall heart function. Rather than slow progression or minimize symptoms of CHF, RT-100 has the potential to halt and reverse the CHF-induced remodeling of the heart, enabling it to pump more effectively. Granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), RT-100 is in late-stage clinical development.

Drug Summary 
Ofranergene obadenovec is a unique biologic agent that uses a dual mechanism to target solid tumors. Based on a non-integrating, non-replicating, Adeno 5 vector, ofranergene obadenovec utilizes VBL’s proprietary Vascular Targeting System (VTS) to target the tumor vasculature for cancer therapy. Unlike anti-VEGF or TKIs, ofranergene obadenovec does not aim to block a specific pro-angiogenic pathway; instead, it uses an angiogenesis-specific sensor (VBL’s PPE-1-3x proprietary promoter) to specifically induce cell death in angiogenic endothelial cells in the tumor milieu. This mechanism retains activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor and shows efficacy even after failure of prior treatment with other anti-angiogenics. Moreover, ofranergene obadenovec induces specific anti-tumor immune response, which is accompanied by recruitment of CD8 T-cells and apoptosis of tumor cells. Ofranergene obadenovec completed a Phase II study in rGBM, which showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients treated with ofranergene obadenovec through progression, compared to either patients treated with ofranergene obadenovec followed by bevacizumab alone, or to historical bevacizumab data.

Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.
Drug Summary 
Lu-PSMA is an experimental drug, a type known as a radiopharmaceutical. The 177lutetium is a radionuclide (radioactive isotope) (the warhead), while the PSMA-617 is a peptide delivering the warhead to cancer cells (the missile). Lu-PSMA is part of an emerging field of cancer therapy known as theranostics, not the easiest word to get your mind around, but one that you are going to hear a lot more about in the coming years. Lu-PSMA is injected intravenously. The purpose is to deliver radioactivity directly to all prostate cancer cells in the body in men with late-stage, metastatic prostate cancer, something that is not possible with externally delivered radiation which needs to be focused just on small areas of the body. Lu-PSMA targets a protein displayed on the surface of prostate cancer cells known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The PSMA-617 part of the drug seeks out this protein. The 177lutetium part of the drug delivers the damage which hopefully slows down or even kills the cancer cell. About 90% of men express PSMA and are suitable for Lu-PSMA treatment.

Drug Summary 
EB-101 is an autologous, gene-corrected cell therapy currently being investigated in the pivotal Phase 3 VIITALTM study for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a rare connective tissue disorder without an approved therapy. The EB-101 VIITALTM study is a multi-center, randomized clinical trial enrolling 10 to 15 RDEB patients with approximately 30 large, chronic wound sites treated in total. Treatment with EB-101 involves using gene transfer to deliver COL7A1 genes into a patient’s own skin cells (keratinocytes and its progenitors) and transplanting them back to the patient to enable normal Type VII collagen expression and facilitate wound healing. Abeona produces EB-101 for the VIITALTM study at its fully-functional gene and cell therapy manufacturing facility in Cleveland, OH. In a Phase 1/2a clinical trial, EB-101 provided durable wound healing for RDEB patients lasting 2+ to 5+ years, including for the largest, most challenging wounds that affect the majority of the RDEB population.

Drug Summary 
HORA-PDE6B is a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector developed for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa due to a mutation in the PDE6B gene. This gene replacement therapy provides an unmutated copy of the human PDE6B gene to replace the defective gene, in order to induce the expression of a functional PDE6? protein in the rod outer segment. HORA-PDE6B is administered as a sterile suspension of viral particles, injected directly into the subretinal space. This triggers the expression of the transgene in the rods (where the PDE6? subunit is expressed) as well as in the cones.

Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.
Drug Summary 
KB105 is Krystal’s second product candidate, currently in clinical development, and seeks to use gene therapy to treat patients with TGM1-deficient ARCI. KB105 is a replication-defective, non-integrating viral vector that has been engineered employing Krystal’s technology platform to deliver functional human TGM1 gene directly to the patients’ dividing and non-dividing skin cells. HSV-1 is Krystal’s replication-deficient, non-integrating viral vector that can penetrate skin cells more efficiently than other viral vectors. Its high payload capacity allows it to accommodate large or multiple genes and its low immunogenicity makes it a suitable choice for direct and repeat delivery to the skin. In May 2020, Krystal Biotech announced interim results for a first-in-human phase 1/2 placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating topical administration of KB105 in patients with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) being presented at the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) annual meeting.

Drug Summary 
Seviteronel (INO-464) is a selective CYP17 lyase and AR inhibitor and the broad collection of multiple patented chemical classes of related compounds that were invented by scientists at Viamet Pharmaceuticals are wholly owned by Innocrin. Innocrin has identified high priority leads that have high CYP17 lyase potency and selectivity. It is Innocrinâ€s intent to leverage its organizational expertise to advance one or more of these 2nd-generation leads into clinical development. In addition to their potential use for the treatment of breast cancer and CRPC, inhibitors that target both CYP17 lyase and AR also have potential for the treatment of other cancers driven by the AR including ovarian, bladder, hepatocellular, and lung. Similarly, these inhibitors may also have commercial potential for the treatment of non-oncologic syndromes that are due to excess sex steroid production.

Talimogene Laherparepvec (Imlygic) is a genetically modified herpes simplex virus type 1 injected directly into tumors where it replicates inside tumors and produces GM-CSF, an immunostimulatory protein. IMLYGIC then causes the tumor to rupture and die in a process called lysis. The rupture of the tumor causes the release of tumor-derived antigens, which together with virally-derived GM-CSF may promote an anti-tumor immune response.  However, the exact mechanism of action is unknown and being further investigated. IMLYGIC is the first oncolytic viral therapy approved by the FDA based on therapeutic benefit demonstrated in a pivotal study.

Overview 
Linzagolix is a novel, orally administered GnRH receptor antagonist with a potentially best-in-class profile in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and pain associated with endometriosis. Linzagolix acts by binding to and blocking the GnRH receptor in the pituitary gland, ultimately resulting in a dose-dependent reduction of the estrogen production by the ovaries. Through previously reported results from linzagolix and sophisticated pharmacological modelling, it has been established that maintaining estradiol within a specific target range provides the optimal balance between reducing symptoms while mitigating bone density loss associated with excessive estradiol suppression. ObsEva licensed linzagolix from Kissei in late 2015 and retains worldwide commercial rights, excluding Asia, for linzagolix.

Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.
Overview 
GSK3228836 is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that has been designed to specifically recognise the messenger RNA (mRNA) that the Hepatitis B virus uses to make viral antigens (disease-causing protein) in infected cells (hepatocytes) in the liver. It helps to destroy the mRNA by recruiting the liver’s own enzymes to digest it to an inactive form. The subsequent reduction in the levels of the mRNA results in a decrease in the production of viral antigen (HBsAg) by the hepatocytes, which can be measured by a drop in the antigen levels in the circulating blood. GSK3228836 (previously known as ‘ISIS 505358 or IONIS-HBVRX’) was discovered by and jointly developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals. GSK3228836 is one of the ASO HBV programme assets in-licensed by GSK from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in August 2019. GSK is now fully responsible for all development, regulatory and commercialisation activities and costs.

Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.
Drug Summary 
GT005 is designed to restore balance to an overactive complement system, a part of the immune system, by increasing production of the CFI protein. An overactive complement system has been implicated in the development of AMD. The CFI protein regulates the activity of the complement system. It is believed that increasing CFI production will dampen the system’s overactivity and reduce inflammation, with the goal of preserving a person’s eyesight. Research has found that approximately 3% of people with dry AMD have certain CFI mutations that correlate with low CFI levels in the blood and a higher risk of developing AMD. Gyroscope estimates that more than 100,000 people with GA in the United States and EU5 European countries may have these mutations. It is estimated that approximately one million people in the United States alone have GA. Gyroscope therefore plans to initiate a second Phase II trial in 2020 that will evaluate GT005 in a broader GA population.

Drug Summary 
CD59 is a protective protein that is normally found on the plasma membrane of cells. CD59 protects cells from a natural inflammatory cascade in the body called complement that acts as a part of the body’s nonspecific immune response. An overactivity of complement is felt to be the cause of macular degeneration. Studies have also shown that patients with AMD have less CD59 present in the retina to protect their cells from damage caused by complement. Hemera’s gene therapy that is under FDA approved clinical testing to treat both the dry and wet forms of AMD is called HMR59. HMR59 injected in the eye increases the ability of retina cells to make a soluble form of CD59 called sCD59. The soluble CD59 circulates within the retina to block complement from further damaging the retina.

Drug Summary 
CD59 is a protective protein that is normally found on the plasma membrane of cells. CD59 protects cells from a natural inflammatory cascade in the body called complement that acts as a part of the body’s nonspecific immune response. An overactivity of complement is felt to be the cause of macular degeneration. Studies have also shown that patients with AMD have less CD59 present in the retina to protect their cells from damage caused by complement. Hemera’s gene therapy that is under FDA approved clinical testing to treat both the dry and wet forms of AMD is called HMR59. HMR59 injected in the eye increases the ability of retina cells to make a soluble form of CD59 called sCD59. The soluble CD59 circulates within the retina to block complement from further damaging the retina.

The product details cover mechanism of action, dosage and administration, route of synthesis, and Research and development activity including regulatory milestones, and other development activities. Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.
Overview 
Fosmanogepix, is a novel broad-spectrum antifungal agent being evaluated in multiple clinical trials in patients with life-threatening fungal infections. Enrollment was recently completed in a Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the intravenous and oral formulations of fosmanogepix for the treatment of patients with Candida infections. In that study, fosmanogepix demonstrated a high level of treatment success in the first 10 patients treated. Additional Phase 2 studies of fosmanogepix are ongoing in patients with Aspergillus and other mold infections, as well as infections caused by multi-drug-resistant Candida auris, a life-threatening fungal infection recently characterized as an “urgent” threat by the Centers for Disease Control.
Fosmanogepix has a novel mechanism of action, and its active moiety has shown broad-spectrum activity against common species of Candida and Aspergillus, including multi-drug-resistant strains, such as C. auris and C. glabrata, as well as rare hard-to-treat molds including Fusarium, Scedosporium, and some fungi from the Mucorales order. Invasive fungal infections result in high mortality rates (30-80%), despite standard-of-care treatment. The frequency of fungi resistant to both the azole and echinocandin classes of drugs is increasing, and there is a significant unmet medical need for a new broad-spectrum antifungal agent.
Fosmanogepix has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for seven separate indications, and is designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of four indications.

Overview 
Dupilumab is an interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha antagonist. It is a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4 subclass that inhibits IL-4 and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by specifically binding to the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit, which is shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the type 1 receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling via the type 2 receptor. By blocking the IL-4R alpha subunit, dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced responses, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immunoglobulin E.

Overview 
A4250 (Odevixibat) is a potent, non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). Albireo is developing odevixibat to treat rare pediatric cholestatic liver diseases, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, biliary atresia and Alagille syndrome. With normal function, approximately 95 percent of bile acids released from the liver into the bile ducts to aid in liver function are recirculated to the liver via the IBAT in a process called enterohepatic circulation. In people with cholestatic liver diseases, the bile flow is interrupted, resulting in elevated levels of toxic bile acids accumulating in the liver and serum. Accordingly, a product capable of inhibiting the IBAT could lead to a reduction in bile acids returning to the liver and may represent a promising approach for treating cholestatic liver diseases.

Overview 
Tadekinig alfa is a recombinant interleukin-18 binding protein (r-hIL-18BP), that binds with high affinity to IL-18, a major inflammatory mediator. It is administered subcutaneously. In healthy people, IL-18 and IL-18BP are present constitutively in blood with a large excess of IL-18BP keeping levels of free IL-18 undetectable. However, in patients with inflammatory diseases, the IL-18/IL-18BP balance is disrupted, resulting in high levels of free and active IL-18, which leads to pathological inflammation. While the time-limited inflammatory response is a natural defense mechanism intended to clear pathogens and limit harm to the body, dysregulated and persistent inflammatory processes are the basis of several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Administration of Tadekinig alfa restores the IL-18/IL-18BP balance, by removing free IL-18 and thereby reducing inflammation.
Excellent safety and tolerability of Tadekinig alfa have been demonstrated in human subjects in Phase 1/1b clinical trials and a Phase 2 trial. Early signs of efficacy of Tadekinig alfa have been shown in a Phase 2 trial in patients suffering from refractory Adult onset Still’s disease, as well in single compassionate use cases in NLRC4-MAS, XIAP, and Systemic onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.

Overview 
IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx is an investigational antisense medicine designed to reduce the production of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) protein in the lung. ENaC is believed to be hyperactive in cystic fibrosis (CF), which is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. Reduction of ENaC with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in preclinical mouse models of cystic fibrosis lung disease leads to significant decrease of mucus accumulation and inflammation, hallmarks of CF lung disease, and improved lung function. This drug is delivered to the lung via aerosol delivery, which results in broad distribution of ASO in the lung with minimal systemic exposure.

Overview 
ARO-ENaC is designed to reduce activity of the epithelial sodium channel alpha subunit in the airways of the lung. In patients with CF, dysfunction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) causes increased ENaC activity which contributes to airway dehydration and reduced mucociliary transport. This predisposes patients to persistent lung infections, structural damage, and progressive loss of pulmonary function. ENaC has been extensively explored as a potential therapeutic target for CF, but the development of inhaled small molecule ENaC inhibitors has been limited by on-target renal toxicity and short duration of action in the lung.

Overview 
Eluforsen, formerly known as QR-010, is a first-in-class RNA-based oligonucleotide designed to address the underlying cause of the disease by targeting the mRNA in CF patients that have the F508del mutation. The technology was exclusively licensed from Massachusetts General Hospital. The F508del mutation results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein that does not function normally. Eluforsen is a single agent designed to bind to the defective CFTR mRNA and to restore CFTR function. Eluforsen is designed to be self-administered via an optimized eFlow Nebulizer (PARI Pharma GmbH). eFlow is a small, handheld aerosol delivery device which nebulizes eluforsen into a mist inhaled directly into the lungs. Eluforsen has been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union and fast-track status by the FDA.

Vertex Pharma is investigating medicines aimed at treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed and cannot move through the cell normally. This results in little to no protein at the cell surface. VX-121 and tezacaftor are designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the CFTR protein. VX-561 (deutivacaftor) is designed to keep CFTR proteins at the cell surface open longer to improve the flow of salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.

Overview 
Garadacimab (previously known as CSL312) is a novel Factor XIIa-inhibitory monoclonal antibody (FXIIa mAb) currently in Phase 3 clinical development as a new type of once-monthly subcutaneous prophylactic treatment for attacks related to HAE, a form of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Garadacimab inhibits the plasma protein, FXIIa. When FXIIa is activated, it initiates the cascade of events leading to edema formation. By targeting FXIIa, garadacimab can prevent the initiation of this cascade. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan-drug designation to garadacimab as an investigational therapy for the prevention of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. CSL Behring is also investigating garadacimab for other indications, beyond HAE, where FXIIa inhibition may be a factor in improving clinical outcomes.

Overview 
ASN002, also known as Gusacitinib is a potent inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). JAK kinases play a significant role in these inflammatory conditions. SYK is a vital mediator of immunoreceptor signaling in macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and B cells. JAK/SYK inhibitors can impact several pathways involved in inflammation of CHE and other dermatologic and inflammatory diseases, thus holding promise as potential therapeutics.  Gusacitinib blocks the Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 pathways and modulates immunoreceptor signaling in innate immune system cells as well as in keratinocytes. Its ability to target such a broad range of cytokines and cells suggests it would have activity for treating Chronic Hand Eczema (CHE) regardless of its underlying cause.

When TNF binds to TNFR1 or TNFR2, it activates important inflammatory pathways, such as NFkB and MAPK. Etanercept for treating Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus under investigation will be administered via the intradermal route, which will provide local concentration to neutralise TNF in tissue while minimising the effect to systemic immunity.

Overview 
XmAb14045, also known as Vibecotamab, SQZ622 is a tumor-targeted bispecific antibody that contains both a CD123 binding domain and a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain (CD3). CD123 is a hallmark for hematological and lymphatic malignancies . XmAb14045 functions to “bring together” tumor cells expressing CD123 and cytotoxic T cells, which bind CD3. The T cells are then activated to kill the CD123- expressing target cells. It is a full-length immunoglobulin molecule designed to be dosed intermittently. The structural stability and modularity of XmAb Bispecific Fc domain has enabled the vibecotamab’s potency to balance anti-tumor activity with the reduction of immune toxicity that can result from T-cell activation.

It further highlights the market competitors, late-stage emerging therapies, and patent details in the global space. 

Drug Summary
Trastuzumab emtansine, sold under the brand name Kadcyla, is an ADC being studied in HER2-positive cancers. It is the first ADC to result from Roche and Genentech’s 30 years of HER2 pathway research and the third medicine Roche has developed for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Like Herceptin, Kadcyla binds to HER2-positive cells and is thought to block out-of-control signals that make the cancer grow while also calling on the body's immune system to attack the cancer cells. Once Kadcyla is taken up by those cells, it is designed to destroy them by releasing the DM1 inside the cells.
Roche licenses technology for Kadcyla under an agreement with ImmunoGen. 
In February 2013, Roche announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine or T-DM1) for the treatment of people with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who have received prior treatment with Herceptin (trastuzumab) and a taxane chemotherapy.

Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.

Overview 
Loncastuximab tesirine (Lonca, formerly ADCT-402) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human CD19 and conjugated through a linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin. Once bound to a CD19-expressing cell, Lonca is designed to be internalized by the cell, following which the warhead is released. The warhead is designed to bind irreversibly to DNA to create highly potent interstrand cross-links that block DNA strand separation, thus disrupting essential DNA metabolic processes such as replication and ultimately resulting in cell death. CD19 is a clinically validated target for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. It is being developed by ADC Therapeutics.
A Biologics License Application for Lonca for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been granted priority review status.

Drug Summary
Idelalisib, sold under the brand name Zydelig is a medication for the treatment of Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, Follicular lymphoma. Zydelig is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Idelalisib is an inhibitor of PI3K? kinase, which is expressed in normal and malignant Bcells. Idelalisib induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in cell lines derived from malignant B-cells and in primary tumor cells. Idelalisib inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the CXCR4 and CXCR5 signaling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib resulted in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.
In July 2014, the FDA granted accelerated approval to idelalisib (Zydelig tablets; Gilead Sciences, Inc.) for the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.

Further, it also consists of future market assessments inclusive of the market forecast, SWOT analysis, market competitors, and other emerging therapies.

Overview 
Atezolizumab is a cancer immunotherapy, which is a type of treatment that uses the body’s own immune system to fight cancer. It is a monoclonal antibody that has been designed to bind a protein called programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).PD-L1 is normally found on the surface of healthy cells, and functions by binding to its receptor PD-1 found on the surface of immune cells called T-cells. This binding sends a signal to the T-cells to stop fighting, ensuring that normal cells are not mistakenly attacked by the immune system. Cancer cells can also produce PD-L1 and evade detection by the immune system. It is being developed by Genentech.
When Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, which is produced by cancer cells at much higher levels than normal cells, it restores the normal function of the immune system, ensuring that T-cells recognize, attack, and kill cancer cells.

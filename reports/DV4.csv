Deep Brain Stimulation Devices Overview
Deep Brain Stimulation Devices: Understanding
The deep brain stimulation device is a battery-operated, surgically-implanted device. It is sometimes called a pacemaker for the brain. DBSs are commonly used to treat movement disorders as well as neuropsychiatric disorders. DBS is a therapy that relies on the delivery of mild electrical pulses to specific areas in the brain via an implanted lead connected to a battery-powered pulse generator placed in the patient’s upper chest area. A physician is able to vary and control the stimulation delivered through the lead to the brain using an external, hand-held programmer. At present, DBS systems use leads with electrodes that send out electrical current in all direction.
Who needs a deep brain stimulation device?

Geography Covered
• Global coverage
Coronary Stents: Overview
Coronary Stents: Understanding
Coronary stents are small, wire, mesh tubes that help widen a clogged artery and restore adequate blood flow to the heart. During the procedure, the cardiologist place the stent over a thin, long tube with a balloon tip called a catheter and insert it into an artery in groin or arm. Once the stent reaches the clogged artery, the doctor will inflate the balloon to expand the stent. When the stent reaches the desired size to widen the clogged artery, the doctor will deflate and remove the balloon. The stent will stay in place permanently to help prop open the artery and decrease its chance of narrowing again. Over time, the inner lining of the artery will grow over the surface of the stent, making it a permanent part of artery.
Types of Coronary Stents
Bare-Metal Stents: Tt is tiny wire mesh tubes that help widen a clogged artery, but are not coated with a polymer or drugs to help prevent re-blockage of the artery. This type of stent may be used in patients who are allergic to either the polymer or drugs used in drug-eluting stents.
Drug-Eluting Stents: A drug-eluting stent is a bare-metal stent that has been coated with a polymer that gradually releases a drug over the time when re-blockage is most likely to happen. This helps reduce the chance of the artery becoming blocked again. There are two types of drug-eluting stents: Permanent Polymer Drug-Eluting Stent and Bioabsorbable Polymer Drug-Eluting Stent.

Heart disease has been the world's biggest cause of mortality, with this trend forecast to continue into the near future. Common disorders contribute to blood vessel stenosis or occlusion. Surgeries using vascular grafts such as coronary artery bypass grafting and peripheral artery bypass grafting is the recommended treatment for long-term revascularization of occluded vessels. Over the past forty years, significant progress has been made in our perception of successful regeneration of the blood vessels, beginning with the inadequacies of early tissue-engineered vascular grafts engineered using isolated components or molecules, such as collagen gels. In the coming years, all these advancements will eventually lead to growth in the market.

Development Activities 
• February 2021, Luo et al. generated vascular smooth muscle cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells and cultured them on biodegradable polyglycolic acid scaffolds exposed to pulsatile radial stress. When implanted into rats, these TEVGs showed high mechanical strength with no dilation, elongation, or wall thickening. Moreover, the TEVGs associated with limited thrombosis and showed no teratoma formation. Further optimization and engineering to limit immune rejection should provide cells and tissues suitable for treating injury or dysfunction of the cardiovascular system.
• In the present study, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and chitosan (CS) were chosen as the anti-thrombotic and anti-bacterial components, respectively; and then an asymmetric vascular graft was fabricated by co-electrospinning. The outer layer of the graft had a certain anti-bacterial effect owing to the addition of chitosan. Besides, the inner layer of the graft could greatly promote the growth of endothelial cells. It is believed that the asymmetric SDVG with anti-thrombotic and anti-bacterial functions could contribute to the future clinical implantation of tissue engineered vascular grafts.

Colonoscopes Overview
Colonoscopes: Understanding
Colonoscopes are used for the removal of foreign bodies, excision of tumors or colorectal polyps (polypectomy), and control of hemorrhage. Routine colonoscopy is important in diagnosing intestinal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. These endoscopic procedures reduce the need for invasive surgical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. There are two types of Colonoscopes: Video and fiberoptic. 
Principles of operation 
Video colonoscope insertion tubes contain a fi beroptic light bundle, which transmits light from the light source to the tip of the endoscope. Each fi beroptic bundle consists of thousands of individual glass fi bers coated with glass causing internal refl ections that allow light transmission through the fi ber even when it is fl exed. The light is used to illuminate the fi eld of view in the patient’s colon. Video images are detected by the CCD and are then transmitted to the video processor and then display monitors or recording devices.

Electroencephelographs Overview
Electroencephelographs: Understanding
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a noninvasive test that records electrical patterns in your brain. The test is used to help diagnose conditions such as seizures, epilepsy, head injuries, dizziness, headaches, brain tumors and sleeping problems. It can also be used to confirm brain death. 
How does an EEG work? 
The billions of nerve cells in your brain produce very small electrical signals that form patterns called brain waves. During an EEG, small electrodes and wires are attached to your head. The electrodes detect your brain waves and the EEG machine amplifies the signals and records them in a wave pattern on graph paper or a computer screen.

Hemodialysis Catheters Overview
Hemodialysis Catheters: Understanding
Hemodialysis is a treatment used when your kidneys fail (Stage 5 Kidney Disease) and can no longer clean your blood and remove extra fluid from your body.
The catheter used for hemodialysis is a tunneled catheter because it is placed under the skin. There are two types of tunneled catheters: cuffed or non-cuffed. Non-cuffed tunneled catheters are used for emergencies and for short periods (up to 3 weeks). Tunneled cuffed catheters, a type recommended by the NKF for temporary access, can be used for longer than 3 weeks when:
• An AV fistula or graft has been placed but is not yet ready for use.
• There are no other options for permanent access. For example, when a patient’s blood vessels are not strong enough for a fistula or graft.

Development Activities
• May 2021, Study findings indicated that although most patients who had insurance before developing end-stage renal disease initiate hemodialysis with a central venous catheter, use of fistula for vascular access demonstrated the lowest risk for subsequent bloodstream infections. The researchers contended that the initiation of hemodialysis with a fistula has repeatedly been shown to lead to better outcomes than initiation with a central venous catheter (CVC), the latter of which has been linked to septicemia and high mortality rates.
• A recently published review, “Preventing Bloodstream infections in Hemodialysis Patients” by Michele H. Mokrzycki, in the March 2021 issue states that, the costs of dialysis care are high and will likely continue to rise as a result of increased life expectancy and improved therapies for causes of kidney failure such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.

Geography Covered
• Global coverage
Pacemakers Overview 
Pacemakers: Understanding
A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. A pacemaker can relieve some arrhythmia symptoms, such as fatigue and fainting. It can also help a person who has abnormal heart rhythms resume a more active lifestyle.
Pacemakers have one to three wires that are each placed in different chambers of the heart.
• The wires in a single-chamber pacemaker usually carry pulses from the generator to the right ventricle (the lower right chamber of your heart).
• The wires in a dual-chamber pacemaker carry pulses from the generator to the right atrium (the upper right chamber of your heart) and the right ventricle. The pulses help coordinate the timing of these two chambers' contractions.
• The wires in a biventricular pacemaker carry pulses from the generator to an atrium and both ventricles. The pulses help coordinate electrical signaling between the two ventricles. This type of pacemaker also is called a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device
Who needs Pacemakers?
• Aging or heart disease damages sinus node's ability to set the correct pace for heartbeat
• Patient who has undergone medical procedure to treat an arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation
• heart muscle problems that cause electrical signals to travel too slowly through your heart muscle

Development Activities
• In February 2021, Researchers at Texas Heart Institute (THI) and UCLA crossed a significant milestone in the development of wirelessly powered, leadless pacemakers. In an article in the Nature Research journal Scientific Reports, the team used their innovative pacing system to reveal the ability to provide synchronized biventricular pacing to a human-sized heart in a preclinical research model. The team is currently working on further miniaturizing the wirelessly powered pacemaker to make it implantable at one or more desired pacing sites on the heart in a minimally invasive manner. This will eliminate the need for intravascular leads and, most importantly, allow for synchronized and leadless pacing across multiple chambers of the heart, which offers the ability to provide patient-specific CRT.

• In January 2021, Medtronic has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Micra AV, a pacemaker with atrioventricular (AV) synchrony. Medtronic will begin training field personnel and physicians, and will activate a limited number of implanting centres in the coming weeks, with full launch anticipated later in spring.

"Jan, 2021",Pharma & Healthcare,Urinary Catheters–Pipeline Insight and Competitive Landscape 2021,3500,7000,60,"DelveInsight’s, “Urinary Catheters–Pipeline Insight and Competitive Landscape 2021,” report provides comprehensive insights about 20+ companies and 20+ pipeline devices in Urinary Catheters pipeline landscape. Urinary Catheters are used in disorder like Urinary retention, Urinary incontinence, Dementia & Surgeries on prostate or genitals. These mainly include indwelling (Foley) catheter, intermittent (short term) catheter, and external (condom) catheter. Advancements in equipment were made from the original latex rubber to silicone, and a variety of coatings are being used such as Teflon and hydrogel. Drainage eyes have been modified in size and shape to enhance urine flow and decrease clogging. Antiseptic and antibiotic coatings also are applied on catheters to combat the bacteria that the catheter had introduced into the bladder. Companies of devices are already trying to have many alterations to reduce the risk of trauma and infection associated with those catheters. Growing interest in advanced urinary catheters and favorable Regulatory policies are key factors that contribute to greater demand for urinary catheters which will eventually led to market boost.
Geography Covered
• Global coverage
Urinary Catheters Overview
Urinary Catheters: Understanding
A urinary catheter is a flexible tube used to empty the bladder and collect urine in a drainage bag. They can either be inserted through the tube that carries urine out of the bladder (urethral catheter) or through a small opening made in your lower tummy (suprapubic catheter). The catheter usually remains in the bladder, allowing urine to flow through it and into a drainage bag.
Specific reasons a urinary catheter may be used include: 
• To allow urine to drain if there is an obstruction in the tube that carries urine out of bladder (urethra). For example, because of scarring or prostate enlargement
• To allow to urinate in case of bladder weakness or nerve damage that affects ability to pee
• To drain bladder during childbirth if there is an epidural anaesthetic
• To drain bladder before, during or after some types of surgery
• To deliver medicine directly into the bladder, such as during chemotherapy for bladder cancer
• As a last resort treatment for urinary incontinence when other types of treatment have been unsuccessful

The report also provides list of major players involved in the pipeline product development. 
• Product Type
There are 2 main types of urinary catheter:
• Intermittent catheters – these are temporarily inserted into the bladder and removed once the bladder is empty
• Indwelling catheters – these remain in place for many days or weeks, and are held in position by an inflated balloon in the bladder

• Product Application
Urinary Catheters can have an application in various medical conditions and diseases – Benign prostate hyperplasia, Urinary incontinence, Spinal cord injury and others, which are covered in the report. 

• Major  Players in Urinary Catheters
There are approx. 20+ key companies which are developing the products for Urinary Catheters.

• Foley-type urinary catheter: Tractivus

This segment of the report provides a detailed list of any commercial activity in the field of urinary catheters devices ranging from collaboration, mergers and acquisition, recent breakthrough among others. 
Development Activities
• In Oct 2019, the most notable development in catheter-related products so far is the hydrophilic coating. Fortunately, in Korea, the national insurance has recently covered the cost for CIC catheters in SCI patients with NB. In several small-scale studies, hydrophilic coating catheter is thought to reduce the discomfort and urethral mucosa damage to some extent. Therefore, such hydrophilic coating catheter may be useful if at least existing catheter is difficult to insert into the urethra, if the patient experienced urethral damage, or frequent recurrence of UTI.
• In July 2019, a new type of female indwelling catheter technology reduced inpatient catheter-associated UTIs, or CAUTIs, by 51.7%, according to data presented at the annual conference of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. These data mirror findings of a second study presented at APIC that similarly showed a decrease in indwelling urinary catheter use in female patients — but not a reduction of CAUTIs — after external catheters were used.
Further commercial activities are provided in the report……..
Urinary Catheters Devices: Regulatory 
For urine collector and accessories intended to be connected to an indwelling catheter. The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to 876.9. under CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21.

Dental Implants Overview
Dental Implants: Understanding
One of the key factors favoring the market for dental implants are also the rising number of dental injuries due to road accidents and sports injuries. Dental implants are long-term replacements that hold adjacent teeth in case. It is known as the only technique of restoration that retains and stimulates the natural bone and also acts as a stable support for dentures. In addition, unlike removable dentures, dental implants enhance a person's physical appearance and offer comfort and convenience.
Factors such as increased healthcare spending, oral hygiene awareness, and the use of advanced oral care technologies are expected to significantly boost the growth of the demand for dental implants. The prevalence of tooth decay among the geriatric population is strong, which is likely to further strengthen the market for procedures for tooth replacement.

Enteral Feed Devices Overview
Enteral Feed Devices: Understanding
An enteral feeding device is a medical device used to provide nutrition to people who cannot obtain nutrition by mouth, are unable to swallow safely, or need nutritional supplementation. In addition, enteral feeding refers to intake of food via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
In patients suffering from chronic diseases such as malnutrition, gastrointestinal disorder, cancer, and others, enteral feeding devices are medical devices used to provide drugs and nutrition. Being fed through a tube helps them to get nutrients and keep their GI tract functioning. The whole caloric consumption of enteral feeding can be made up or can be used as a supplement. The development of compact and portable enteral feeding pumps, which are built using materials that resist cracking in high-stress applications, has also led to technological advances. Advanced pump features include suitable programming options, scheduled flushing intervals, multiple language options, and warning options for occlusion strain, previous feed rate history, and manipulation-preventing screen and programed lock-out features.
However, the use of these machines is associated with a few risks, resulting in additional healthcare costs. Most of the enteral feeding-related complications are mild, but some may be very severe.

Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) Overview
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD): Understanding
Defibrillation is used for patients suffering from life threatening conditions which effect the heart’s rhythm such cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillators help in delivering an electrical shock or send an electrical impulse to the heart, thus causing depolarization of the heart muscles and maintaining the normal conduction of the heart’s impulse. They can also be used to restore the heartbeat incase the heart stops functioning.
The market for defibrillators in rising with the increasing cases of arrhythmia due to high prevalence of heart diseases, ageing population, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc. Defibrillators can prevent sudden death among people who have a high risk of a life-threatening arrhythmia.
These are different type of defibrillators that are used to assist people in case of a sudden cardiac arrest or arrhythmia. Automated Cardioverter Defibrillator is a light-weight, battery operated and portable device that works by checking the rhythm of the heart and sends a shock to the heart in order to restore the normal heartbeat. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators are used in patients suffering from cardiac, which obstruct the flow of the blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Therefore, the device is surgically implanted in the chest/ abdomen that can send a shock to correct arrhythmia. Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillators have sensors attached with the skin. These are connected by the help of wires to a unit which keeps a check on the rhythm of the heat and corrects it by sending a shock.

Intraocular lenses (IOL) are the medical devices which are implanted inside the eye to replace natural eye lens; so as to treat cataract or refractive errors. Growth in this market can be attributed to the rapid growth in the geriatric population and associated eye disorders, rising prevalence of eye diseases & diabetes in the overall population across the globe, technological advancements in intraocular lenses, and increasing government initiatives to control and treat blindness caused by cataract. This report provides a detailed study of the emerging Intraocular Lens (IOL) devices along with competitive landscape to help better understand the emerging Intraocular Lens (IOL) devices. 
Geography Covered
• Global coverage
Intraocular Lens (IOL) Overview
Intraocular Lens (IOL): Understanding
These lenses can be used as an alternative or adjunct to corneal astigmatic incisions for correcting preexisting astigmatism in patients with cataracts. They are a particularly attractive option in those cases where limbal-relaxing incisions are not powerful or predictable enough. Other lenses may correct astigmatism in addition to spherical refractive errors in patients. An intraocular lens implant, or IOL, is a transparent plastic implant and is around one third the size of a dime. Several different forms exists:
• Monofocal IOL: This is the most common, this implant stays focused at one fixed distance. 
• Multifocal implant: Like glasses with bifocal or progressive lenses, this lens has areas that help see things at different distances. It could take several months for brain to adapt so vision seems natural. It can sometimes cause more halos or glare around lights than a monofocal lens. 
• Accommodating IOL: This flexible option acts more like natural lens and focuses at more than one distance. It makes less likely to need reading glasses.
• Toric IOL: if a cornea that's more football-shaped than round or have astigmatism, this lens lessens astigmatism so won't need glasses to correct it after surgery.
How does an Intraocular Lens (IOL) work? 
A specifically engineered artificial lens called the intraocular lens, is inserted into the eye at the time of eye surgery to take the place of the clouded human lens. It is permanently fixated inside the eye, unlike a contact lens. 
The IOL is permanent because it is made of a substance that is fully translucent that can never cloud. Once in place, it won't move, because there are no moving parts in the lens that could wear out over time, unlike an artificial joint or heart valve.

The laparoscopy technique uses numerous devices to view the abdominal organs, such as a laparoscope. It is a long thin tube with a high-intensity light on the front side and a high-resolution camera. Laparoscopic surgery uses long pencil tools that can reach the abdominal wall by small cuts and are obtained from durable materials made of high-quality stainless steel. During laparoscopic procedures, different instruments such as needle driver for suturing, trocar, bowel grasper and surgical mesh are used. Compared to conventional surgery, laparoscopy devices have many benefits because it causes minimal injury or cutting, and patients is discharged of the hospital faster. In addition to this since the size of the incision made is smaller than the wide incision made for open surgery, the chance of bleeding during laparoscopic surgery is less.
In order to reduce postoperative pain and recovery times, laparoscopic devices are considerably introduced and have become the most common way for many abdominal surgeries. Laparoscopy instruments continue to play an important role in both conventional open surgery and traditional laparoscopic procedures as the ideal alternative. In addition, the growing prevalence of anatomical health disorders is also complementing the demand for equipment for laparoscopy.
In certain cases, however the possibility of significant complications for open and laparoscopic approaches may be similar and may prove to be a constraining factor for the growth of this industry.

Peritoneal Dialysis Equipment Overview
Peritoneal Dialysis Equipment: Understanding
An increased incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension increases the risk of acute kidney injury. Peritoneal dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that uses the lining of abdomen, or belly, to filter blood inside body. Health care providers call this lining the peritoneum. A few weeks before the start of peritoneal dialysis, a surgeon places a soft tube, called a catheter, in belly. When the treatment starts, dialysis solution—water with salt and other additives—flows from a bag through the catheter into the belly. After a few hours, the solution and the wastes are drained out of belly into the empty bag. The used solution can be thrown away in a toilet or tub. Then, can start over with a fresh bag of dialysis solution. When the solution is fresh, it absorbs wastes quickly. As time passes, filtering slows. For this reason, the process needs to be repeated by emptying the used solution and refilling the belly with fresh solution four to six times every day. This process is called an exchange.
Exchanges can be done during the day, or at night using a machine that pumps the fluid in and out. For the best results, it is important that exchanges are performed as prescribed. Dialysis can help one feel better and live longer, but it is not a cure for kidney failure.
How does a Peritoneal Dialysis Equipment work? 
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) works by using body’s peritoneal membrane and exchanges of dialysate fluid to filter and clean blood. Peritoneal dialysis solution, also called dialysate, is the fluid used to absorb waste products, toxins and extra fluid from body through the lining of abdomen, also called the peritoneum. Peritoneal dialysis solution is made of water and electrolytes. The electrolytes are mostly salts and sugar that are naturally found in body. The waste, toxins and fluid are then removed from body during dialysis, leaving the right amounts of electrolytes and nutrients in blood for body to use. There are different strengths of dialysate depending on body’s needs. Nephrologist will prescribe the strength that is right For Patient. 
Exchanges can be done manually throughout the day or by using a peritoneal dialysis machine—also called a cycler—at night.
Once PD cycler is hooked via peritoneal catheter and are ready to begin, cycler will do the number of exchanges needed in 1 session over an 8-to-10-hour period. Most people like to use their cyclers at night while they sleep, so they can have their days free. Each exchange is a 3-step process: peritoneal cavity is filled with dialysate solution, it ""dwells"" there for the time needed to clean blood and remove excess fluid and then the solution is drained out. Cycler repeats this process until completed the number of exchanges prescribed by nephrologist, which may be 3 to 5 cycles.

Thoracic Aortic Stent Grafts Overview
Thoracic Aortic Stent Grafts: Understanding
The word endovascular refers to the area inside of a blood vessel such as the aorta. Endovascular stent grafting, or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), is a newer form of treatment for thoracic aortic aneurysms that is less invasive than open surgery. Endovascular stent grafting uses a device called an endovascular stent graft. The endovascular stent graft is a synthetic fabric tube (graft) supported by a metal scaffold (stent). 
How does a Thoracic Aortic Stent Grafts work? 
During endovascular stent grafting the endovascular stent graft is placed inside thoracic aorta using a long, thin, soft, plastic tube called a delivery catheter. Thoracic aortic aneurysms can weaken the aorta, body’s largest blood vessel. This can develop into a potentially serious health problem that can be fatal if the aneurysm bursts, causing massive internal bleeding.  The endovascular stent is placed inside of thoracic aorta to help reinforce the blood vessel and prevent the aneurysm from rupturing. The catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg near the groin. Using advanced imaging methods, the surgeon guides the catheter carrying the stent graft to the area of the aneurysm inside the aorta. Once the stent graft is in position, the surgeon deploys it into place and removes the catheter.

Geography Covered
• Global coverage
Wound Closure Devices: Overview
Wound Closure Devices: Understanding
Since the earliest growth of suturing products, wound closing methods have developed to provide tools that include plastic sutures, absorbable, staples, tapes, and adhesive compounds. Superior cosmetic effects have been obtained by the engineering of synthetic material sutures along with the standardization of conventional materials such as catgut and silk. Similarly, the armamentarium of wound closing procedures has complemented the development of topical skin adhesives (monomer 2-octyl cyanoacrylate), surgical staples, and tapes to replace sutures. Both traumatic and surgically caused, aesthetic closing of a wound is dependent on understanding of healing processes and skin anatomy, as well as an awareness of the suture material and the procedure of closing. Optimal healing is ensured by using the correct fabrics. Wound closure techniques have evolved significantly and now range from simple sutures to adhesive compounds.
Clinical Significance of Wound Closure Devices 
There are four distinct stages of wound healing which are (1) hemostasis, (2) inflammatory phase, (3) proliferative (""rebuilding"") phase, and (4) maturation phase. Regardless of the method used, the wound will heal by going through the above mentioned four phases. The primary curing purpose is where sutures or staples pull the wound edges keeps them together. Healing begins with the wound epithelization and connective tissue deposition. This permits lower rates of infection. As there is no epidermal membrane, healing by secondary purpose puts the patient at risk for further infections. The third is tertiary intention healing, also known as primary delayed closing, which involves delayed closing of a wound after a period of time, depending in various situations where the wound has been left open. These wounds are grossly infected but have no substantial loss of tissue, which may theoretically be closed after careful exploration, drainage, debriding, which observation of the wound for 3 to 7 days prior to surgical closure or grafting of the skin.
Today there are natural, synthetic, absorbable, non-absorbable, multifilament, and monofilament sutures available. Synthetic sutures are preferred around the face as they cause a limited reaction, and inflammation is minimized. Absorbable sutures are used in cases where substantial support is not required and the wound heals faster, and internal layers are often used. If one needs continuous mechanical support, non-absorbable sutures are used. Monofilaments are less vulnerable to infection, but surgical tools may traumatize them. Infections may be sustained by multifilaments, but they are susceptible to tangles.
Three main concepts, including proper distribution of stress to the deeper layers, atraumatic tissue handling, and eversion of wound margins, should be integrated into the proper suture technique.

Adalimumab Understanding
Adalimumab: Overview
Adalimumab, sold under the brand name Humira among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It works by blocking a protein (tumor necrosis factor or TNF) found in the body's immune system that causes joint swelling and damage in arthritis as well as red scaly patches in psoriasis. Adalimumab belongs to a class of drugs known as TNF blockers. By reducing joint swelling, this medication helps to reduce further joint damage and preserve joint function. After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in levels of acute phase reactant proteins of inflammation (C­ reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was measured compared to baseline in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

Abrilada is an FDA-approved biosimilar version of adalimumab. Abrilada (adalimumab-afzb) injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous administration. The drug product is supplied as either a single-dose prefilled pen (Abrilada pen), as a single-dose 1 mL prefilled glass syringe, or as a single-dose institutional use vial. Enclosed within the pen is a single-dose 1 mL prefilled glass syringe. Though approved, it is not yet marketed in the US like several other manufacturers of approved biosimilar versions of adalimumab, Pfizer has signed a licensing agreement with AbbVie; under the agreement, Samsung would be able to launch the drug in November 2023.
• Halimatoz: Sandoz
Halimatoz is mostly used in adults when their conditions are severe, moderately severe or getting worse, or when patients cannot use other treatments. Halimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab and is a ‘biosimilar medicine’. The active substance in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and attach to a substance in the body called tumour necrosis factor (TNF). TNF is involved in causing inflammation and is found at high levels in patients with the diseases that Halimatoz is used to treat. By attaching to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases.

Adalimumab Biosimilars: Emerging Drugs
• IBI303: Innovent Biologics
IBI303 is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody of TNF-?, which has the same amino acid sequence as branded adalimumab (Humira) and shows high degrees of similarity in respect to: chemical properties, in vitro biological activity (binding affinity and neutralizing activity against TNF-?), potency, and PK/PD. Pharmacologic and toxicologic studies of IBI303 also showed high similarity to Humira. Clinical studies have demonstrated that IBI303 can significantly alleviate the symptoms and physical signs of AS and decrease the disease activity and enthesitis, while improving both somatic motor ability and mobility of spine in patients with AS. It also improved the quality of life in patients with AS and reduced the disease's impact on their activities of daily life. IBI303 also generated an acceptable safety profile with most of the adverse events graded as mild or moderate. IBI303 may meet Chinese patients' urgent needs with an affordable price at global quality standards.
• CT-P17: Celltrion
CT-P17 is the first high-concentration type of medicine for a biosimilar made of adalimumab. The company has differentiated CT-P17 from existing Humira biosimilars by halving the dosage. By taking the latest trend into account, Celltrion has also removed citrate, which can cause pain in self-injection, from its latest product. If Celltrion launches CT-P17, it will be able to complete a robust portfolio of CT-P17 in the global autoimmune disorder treatment market.

Bevacizumab Understanding
Bevacizumab: Overview
Bevacizumab, sold under the brand name Avastin, is a medication used to treat a number of types of cancers and a specific eye disease. There is a great deal of evidence indicating that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies. In 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market. It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A. Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.

Infliximab Understanding
Infliximab: Overview
Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody, sold under the brand name Remicade among others, is a medication used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases. This includes Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Behçet's disease. Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases. Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades. By binding to both the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-? 1, infliximab disrupts the interaction of TNF-? with its receptors and may also cause lysis of cells that produce TNF-? 1

Filgrastim Understanding
Filgrastim: Overview
Filgrastim, sold under the brand name Neupogen among others, is a medication used to treat low neutrophil count. Low neutrophil counts may occur with HIV/AIDS, following chemotherapy or radiation poisoning, or be of an unknown cause. It is marketed as the brand name Neupogen by Amgen (initially approved in 1998). Filgrastim is a growth factor that stimulates the production, maturation, and activation of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell). Filgrastim also stimulates the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. In patients receiving chemotherapy, filgrastim can accelerate the recovery of neutrophils, reducing the neutropenic phase (the time in which people are susceptible to infections).
Filgrastim Biosimilars: Drugs Chapters
This segment of the Filgrastim report encloses its detailed analysis of various drugs in different stages of clinical development, including marketed, phase III, II, I and preclinical. It also helps to understand clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, and the latest news and press releases.
Filgrastim Biosimilars: Marketed Drugs
• Nivestym: Pfizer
Nivestym is a leukocyte growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The G-CSF receptor through which Nivestym acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that Nivestym acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim products in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. Nivestym is used to treat neutropenia, a lack of certain white blood cells caused by cancer, bone marrow transplant, receiving chemotherapy, or by other conditions. Nivestym may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. In July 2018, Pfizer announced that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved NIVESTYM (filgrastim-aafi), a biosimilar to Neupogen1 (filgrastim), for all eligible indications of the reference product.
• Grastofil: Apotex/Intas
Grastofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of Grastofil are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Grastofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). The active substance in Grastofil, filgrastim, is very similar to a human protein called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Filgrastim acts in the same way as naturally produced G-CSF by encouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells.

Filgrastim Biosimilars: Emerging Drugs
• TX-01: Tanvex Biopharma
Tanvex Biopharma is developing Filgrastim biosimilar labeled as TX-01 for the treatment of Neutropenia. The mechanism of action of the drug is that it acts as Haematopoietic cell growth factor stimulants. In 2019, Tanvex BioPharma receives complete response letter from the US FDA for filgrastim biosimilar (TX 01) in Neutropenia.
• GranNEX: Mycenax Biotech
GranNEX is Mycenax’s filgrastim, the biosimilar version of Neupogen, and the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF. It can stimulate the growth of the white cell. The development of GranNEX followed the regulatory pathway of the biosimilar, with high biosimilarity to its reference product, and complied with the requirements of the European Medicine Agency. This project is granted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and selected as the critical path project by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) in Taiwan. Mycenax has completed GranNEX’s pre-clinical development and will focus on the application of the new delivery system or new formulation for patient’s ease of using GranNEX.

Insulin Glargine Understanding
Insulin Glargine: Overview
Insulin glargine, marketed under the names Lantus among others, is a long-acting insulin, used in the management of type I and type II diabetes. It is typically the recommended long acting insulin in the United Kingdom. It is used once a day as an injection just under the skin. Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.

Interferon Understanding
Interferon: Overview
Interferons are a group of signaling proteins made and released by host cells in response to the presence of several viruses. In a typical scenario, a virus-infected cell will release interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses. Interferon is further categorized in its variants. 
Interferon alfa-2b is an antiviral or antineoplastic drug. It is a recombinant form of the protein Interferon alpha-2 that was originally sequenced and produced recombinantly in E. coli in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann at the University of Zurich, in 1980.
 Interferon beta-1a is a cytokine in the interferon family used to treat multiple sclerosis. It is produced by mammalian cells, while interferon beta-1b is produced in modified E. coli. Some claims have been made that Interferons produce about an 18–38% reduction in the rate of MS relapses.

Somatropin Understanding
Somatropin: Overview
Somatropin is used to treat growth failure in children and adults who lack natural growth hormone. This includes people with short stature due to Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature at birth with no catch-up growth, and other causes. hGH binds to the human growth hormone receptor (GHR). Upon binding, hGH causes dimerization of GHR, activation of the GHR-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of both JAK2 and GHR. These events recruit and/or activate a variety of signaling molecules, including MAP kinases, insulin receptor substrates, phosphatidylinositol 3' phosphate kinase, diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, intracellular calcium, and Stat transcription factors. These signaling molecules contribute to the GH-induced changes in enzymatic activity, transport function, and gene expression that ultimately culminate in changes in growth and metabolism.

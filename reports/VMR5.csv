Global Disposable Blood Bags Market Outlook

The key drivers responsible for the growth of the global disposable blood bags market are the rising incidence of blood-related disorders and increasing number of road accidents that required blood transfusion. Blood transfusion is widely used for supportive care in cardiovascular surgery, transplant surgery, massive trauma, and hematological therapy. According to the New York Blood Center (NYBC), in 2018, car accidents and trauma victims needed more than 50 red cell transfusions during the entire treatment. Moreover, the rising government initiatives for improving healthcare blood management and growing awareness for blood donation are further expected to fuel the market growth. On the other hand, a lack of robust healthcare infrastructure for blood collection, storage, and distribution across various low-income countries is a key factor that might restrict the market growth.

Jun-21,Healthcare,3950,6550,"Surface Disinfectant Market Size And Forecast
Surface Disinfectant Market was valued at USD 612.61 Million in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 1,121.98 Million by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 8.03% from 2020 to 2027.

Global Surface Disinfectant Market Overview
The rising surgical procedure in health care facilities helps push the worldwide market for surface disinfectants. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASAPS), 17.5 million surgical and minimally invasive cosmetic procedures were conducted in the US in 2017 that stood at 17.8 million in 2016. Increasing the incidence of wound infection is also leading to market growth due to inadequate hygiene, sanitation, and other factors. Surface disinfectants have been used to minimize infection of wounds. The frequency of wound infection varies from 2 to 17.5 percent after trauma, and from 1 to 1.5 percent after minor dermatological surgical procedures, as reported by the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Infections are unpleasant and inconvenient, leading to failure or delay in wound healing and poor cosmetic outcomes. An increasing number of surgeries conducted in hospitals combined with the use of disinfectants in surgical procedures to avoid infection, high-quality patient care, employee protection, and hygiene maintenance are compulsory for hospitals across the globe. These factors are anticipated to boost the market growth of surface disinfectants during the forecast period.

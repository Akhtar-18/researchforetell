What is Laparoscopic and Open Hernia Mesh Repair Surgery?
Repair of a hernia in the groin is the most frequently performed operation in the general surgery. A hernia is repaired by either minimal access laparoscopy or an open surgery by stitching or placing a mesh over a hernia. The open hernia repair process does not require any advanced equipment and takes 25% lesser time than laparoscopy. This makes open hernia repair more cost-effective. Moreover, this type of surgery is preferred for hernias that have been present for a long period of time. However, the laparoscopic hernia repair surgery segment is expected to register the highest growth rate, owing to factors such as less postoperative pain, fewer chances of wound infection, and early recovery.
Global Laparoscopic and Open Hernia Mesh Repair Surgery Market Outlook
In the report, the market outlook section mainly encompasses fundamental dynamics of the market which include drivers, restraints, opportunities and challenges faced by the industry. Drivers and restraints are intrinsic factors whereas opportunities and challenges are extrinsic factors of the market.

With the increasing adoption of mesh in hernia repair surgeries, new product developments are augmenting the growth of the market. Moreover, the rising geriatric population and favorable reimbursement scenario in developed countries are some factors expected to drive the growth of the market. However, the high cost associated with mesh repair, the unfavorable reimbursement scenario in developing countries, and the development and adoption of new surgical techniques such as the Desarda technique is some factors limiting the market growth.

What is Gene Panel?
A gene panel is a type of test that helps in the analysis of multiple genes at the same time for cancer-associated mutations. This test is capable to examine several numbers of genes that can provide information about cancer and provide a secure diagnostic to help to prevent or stop cancer to be spread. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two types of genes that are responsible for the production of proteins that help in suppressing tumors. These proteins help in repairing damaged DNA and also prevent the growth of tumor cells. Both women and men can be analyzed for the mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA 2 genes which helps in the estimation of risk for developing a different type of cancer including ovarian, prostate in men, breast cancer in women, and fallopian or peritoneal cancer.

What is Pre-Insulated Plastic Pipes Market?
Pre-insulated pipes have been developed continuously and are widely used in the hot and cold for district heating and hot water supply applications. These Pre-Insulated Pipes are extensively used for energy-related applications. The main purpose of such pipes is to maintain the temperature of the fluid inside the pipes. These piping systems have a wide range of applications in a large number of projects and major benefits can be achieved with the help of these pre-insulated pipe systems. These pipe systems are used in chemical, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and food industries for the transportation of Drinking water, Wastewater, Cooling water, Hot water, Steam, Hydrocarbon, chemicals, oil, and other materials.
The PEX pipe system, also known as cross-linked polyethylene pipe systems are among the most robust piping systems currently on the market. PEX material is formed through cross-linking of high-density polyethylene which itself is already well suited for potable water distribution pipe. The cross-linking process leads to the formation of a chemical bond of molecular carbon chains that in turn forms a 3-dimensional network. Thus stabilized, even application of high temperatures over a long time as well as mechanical and chemical stress have zero negative impact on the operating life of PE-X pipe systems. Pre-insulated PEX pipes are classified into PEX-a, PEX-b, and PEX-c.

Jun-21,Healthcare,3950,6750,"Europe Orthopedic Braces And Support Market
According to Verified Market Research, the Europe Orthopedic Braces and Support Market is expected to be valued at USD 1219.2 Million in 2018 and is expected to witness a growth of 4.5% from 2019-2026 and reach USD 1726.0 Million by 2026.

Europe Orthopedic Braces and Support Market Outlook
The geriatric population in many European countries is rapidly increasing. According to a 2018 Ageing Report, it was stated that the total population in the EU is projected to rise from 511 million in 2016 to 520 million in 2070. However, the working-age population (people aged between 15 and 64) will decline substantially from 333 million in 2016 to 292 million in 2070. Also, according to the world population aging 2017 report, it was stated that older persons are expected to account for 35% (Approx.) of the population in Europe in 2018. This factor will further contribute to the sales of braces and supports in the Europe region.
Currently, the two most common therapies used to treat post-orthopedic surgery pain are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and/or opiates. Administration of these medications offering antinerve growth factor before orthopedic surgery or after bone fracture reduces the skeletal pain by 40% to 70% depending on the end point being assessed. The data suggest that nerve growth factor helps in driving pain caused due to orthopedic surgery or bone fracture. Thus, it can be suggested that adoption of pain reliver medications hinders the growth of orthopedic braces and support and act as a potential restraint for the market.

North America Interpretation Services Market Outlook
The Healthcare Industry has been witnessed to be coming under increasing pressure to provide translation and interpreting services for limited English proficiency (LEP) patients (especially ones that are more cost-effective). With regulations for insurance companies and healthcare providers being updated, all patient-facing materials must be updated as well and distributed to patients in a language they can understand. It is widely acknowledged that inadequate access to information in regards to healthcare services can adversely affect the quality of healthcare and have serious, even life threatening, consequences. With the United States itself witnessing a large number of its population speaking a language other than English at home. Therefore, more than ever, insurance companies and hospitals are trying to provide information pertaining to their health and insurance coverage in various languages.
However, the technology-based interpretation services are rising due to the increasing cost charges of the service providers and the rising issues of privacy of data. There are many incidences that a company has hired a person as an interpreter, but for better pricing interpreter has leaked the information or have limited ability to solve so outsourced it. This all led to the high demand for interpretation technologies. However, there are very limited number of users, aware about the interpretation technologies. This slowed down the growth of the market

Jun-21,Chemicals & Basic Materials,3950,6750,"Copper Busbar And Profiles Market 
According to Verified Market Research, The Global Copper Busbar and Profiles Market was valued at USD 16,321.5 Million in 2018 and is projected to reach USD 24,118.1 Million by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 5.11% from 2019 to 2026.
Global Copper Busbar and Profiles Market Outlook
Few of the major factors driving the copper busbars and profiles market are increased use of copper busbars and profiles in power and electrical equipment sector and increased usage of copper in several industries due to its attractive properties. In electrical power distribution, a copper Busbar is used within various applications such as switchgears, panel boards and bus way enclosures for the purpose of local high current power distribution. Some of the beneficial properties that copper provides include low electrical and thermal resistance, high mechanical strength in tension, high resistance to fatigue failure, ease of fabrication, low electrical resistance of surface films and high resistance to corrosion. As a result of this, busbars are often made from copper or aluminum, especially when considering conductivity and strength, copper is far superior to aluminum.
On the contrary, copper is subject to price fluctuations, which results in irregular manufacturing costs for vendors. Copper prices have fluctuated considerably over the last few years, such fluctuations can also result in reduced profit margins for vendors which is anticipated to be one of the major restraints for the market.

Jun-21,Chemicals & Basic Materials,3950,6750,"Europe Pre-Insulated Plastic Pipes Market
According to Verified Market Research, the Europe Pre-Insulated Plastic Pipes Market is expected to be valued at USD 3,696 Million in 2018 and is expected to witness a growth of 7.6% from 2019-2026 and reach USD 6,600 Million by 2026.

Europe Pre-Insulated Plastic Pipes Market Outlook
District energy, including both heating and cooling, tie together the energy generating sources in a city with buildings and facilities requiring heating and/or cooling. Rather than each building having its own heating or cooling system, the energy is delivered to several buildings in a larger area from a central plant. The water-based distribution system guarantees that the supply of heat and cooling reaches safely to the end users including residential, commercial or multi-occupancy. These systems are highly efficient, sustainable, safe, have lower emissions, and compatible with alternatives such as water, waste, and biomass.
 
 Pre-insulated pipes are widely used in district energy distribution systems to deliver heat in the form of water from one or more central sources to industrial, commercial, and residential users. Heat energy and hot water are supplied to buildings, and each building is capable of individually controlling the temperature. This suggests that the scope of pre-insulated pipes is expected to grow in the region.

Jun-21,Healthcare,3950,6750,"What is Raloxifene Hydrochloride?
Raloxifene Hydrochloride is an estrogen antagonist, a selective benzothiophene estrogen receptor modulator with lipid-lowering effects and activity against osteoporosis. It is sold by brand name Evista. It is used by women to prevent and treat osteoporosis after menopause. It works by slowing down bone loss and helps to keep bones strong, making them less likely to break. 

Global Raloxifene Hydrochloride Market Outlook
Aging of populations worldwide will be major driving factor for increase in the incidence of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The global population aged 60 years or over numbered 962 million in 2017 to 425 million by 2026. Owing to its higher prevalence worldwide, osteoporosis is considered a serious public health concern. With increased life expectancy, osteoporosis is evolving as a serious health problem worldwide, especially in developing countries. At present, approximately 30% of all postmenopausal women have osteoporosis in the United States and in Europe. At least 40% of these women and 15-30% of men will sustain one or more fragility fractures in their remaining lifetime. Furthermore, increasing approvals by FDA in various countries will impede growth by the forecast.

What Is Blood Viscometer?
Blood is the most important fluid of our body and Blood viscometers measure the viscosity of the blood. blood viscometers differ from rheometers as it measures the viscosity of blood in a single flow condition. Viscosity is a property of blood that determines the consistency of blood, the cholesterol level, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. If the blood is more viscous, it means blood will readily attach to the walls of capillaries and thus increasing the workload of the heart. In blood viscometer, the blood flows through the capillary tube and depending upon its viscosity the time of its flow varies. If the blood is more viscous, less will be the blood flow and more will be the chances of cardiovascular risks. With the increasing rise in cardiovascular risks, obesity, and hypertension, patients are regularly checked for their blood viscosity.

Such services are provided by hospitals, spas, and clinics.
